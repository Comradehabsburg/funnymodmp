 USA_1864_campaigning_desc:0 "A state is an electoral unit. The number of electors in each state means the total number of members in the Senate and the House of Representatives for that state. For example: [37.GetName] has 2 senators and 31 representatives, so there are 33 electoral votes. \nThe presidential candidate who receives more than half of the electoral votes wins. The entire United States currently has a "winner-take-all" system, which gives all of the state's electoral votes to the presidential candidate who receives a relative majority of the popular vote in that state. \nIn 1824, John Quincy Adams was finally elected president by a vote of the House of Representatives in such a case (a Contingent election). \N Because of the current rebellion in the southern states, their votes and Electoral College votes would not be counted even if they were already under Union control."
