 usa.18601.d:0 "Fort Sumter was the bridge between peace and war, between political conflict within the Union and war between foreign nations. When news of Anderson reached Washington, those Southern gentlemen still in the capital were seething with rage. Keitt’s 's A group of Carolinians, accompanied by John Floyd and Jefferson Davis, stormed the White House. They were brought before President Buchanan and demanded that he explain why he would not return the memorandum they had previously left him before allowing Anderson to change the status quo. "You all know that it is against my policy to exacerbate the situation there," the surprised president said. Southerners circled Buchanan, each trying to persuade him to order Anderson's men to leave the Port of Charleston altogether; they argued that Anderson's presence was threatening the war; that it was enraging the other slaveholding states, and that as long as Anderson remained, there could be no negotiated peaceful settlement of the South Carolina secession issue. The alarmed president turned from one to the other, refusing to be forced to make concessions. "Gentlemen, you are pressing me too rudely," he said. "You do not give me time to say my words." Keat replied sternly to the president." You promised that there would be no change without notice. If you don't get those people out of Sumter, South Carolina will get them out!"	 As Keitt’s  spoke, the president shook his head, rose from his chair, and walked toward the door." Tomorrow, gentlemen. Come back tomorrow and the government will answer you. I will meet with the cabinet and we will make a decision." When the president convened his cabinet that evening, new faces appeared among the president's advisers. Jeremiah Black, a longtime friend of the president from Pennsylvania, assumed the secretary of state position that Kass had vacated a few weeks earlier. Philip Thomas of Maryland replaces Georgia's Howell Cobb in the Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury. Edwin Stanton from Pennsylvania, - an arrogant bald lawyer - replaced Black in his old position as Attorney General. Secretary of War Floyd began the meeting by loudly insisting that Major Anderson, who had moved to Fort Sumter without orders, should be recalled to Washington to face a court-martial. Black angrily rejected Floyd's claims of Anderson's misconduct. "Anderson did exactly what he was ordered to do," Black said.  "He did not!" Floyd retorted. Stanton suddenly interjected." Where are his orders? Show us his orders! Floyd fumbled through the stack of papers he had brought into the room and found Buell's papers, which he had signed, and when he read the words, "You may defend yourself by placing your men in any of these places," Floyd's eyebrows rose and his lips tightened. Floyd tossed Buell's papers on the conference table and pointed his finger at the president in a rude manner.  Major Anderson has no reason to act, the garrison is not under attack. I understand you to say to the South Carolina legislators that the government will not do anything without giving fair warning. You must order Anderson back to Fort Moultrie or out of port altogether or there will be war!" As Floyd spoke, Jeremiah Black grabbed the paper from the table as he and Stanton headed for a corner. As Black finished reading the text and recognized Floyd's scribbled signature, he turned back to the president and stood between him and Floyd. "You're proposing treason!" He shouted. Now trembling with rage, Floyd pushed himself physically toward Blake. Their eyes were inches apart as the two men glared at each other, hands balled into fists.  "Gentlemen, gentlemen," the president said." Please calm yourselves. Major Anderson's actions were no one's fault. In any case, it's too late to order him back, isn't it? South Carolina now occupies Fort Moultrie." Hearing this, Floyd jerked his head back." Then I must resign from your cabinet, sir.  President's expression hardened, and he looked Floyd steadily in the eye." Well, sir, then go ahead, go ahead, do as you please."  the angry Virginian hesitated for a moment; looking around at each of Buchanan's ministers, his eyes rested on Jacob Thompson of Mississippi. He expected Thompson to speak up and support his point of view, but Thompson remained silent. Then he stormed out of the room. When Floyd left the cabinet room, the president walked to an armchair in front of the fireplace, sighed and sat down heavily. In the silence that followed Floyd's departure, the ministers sat quietly at the conference table, waiting for the president to speak. When he finally broke the silence, the president kept his face turned toward the flames on the logs burning in the fireplace.  "Is it necessary for us to keep a garrison in the ports down there? After all, there are many reasons to believe that South Carolina ceded the location of the fort to the United States solely for the purpose of defending its port; not to provide the federal government with the means to blockade it." Turning his lids to Jeremiah Black, the president said. "Haven't you read those old laws, Jer?" Before Black could respond to Buchanan, Stanton's stern voice echoed through the room. "To order the garrison to leave the port," Stanton said, "is as treasonous as Benedict Arnold giving West Point to the British in 1780.  President Stanton raised his hand to warn him to stop. Like Freud, Stanton's words pierced Buchanan's heart; but he didn't want to let the ministers leave that night again.  "Oh, no, Stanton! It's not that bad. ...... It can't be that bad," he replied sarcastically.  the next day, a messenger showed up at the K Street house where Keitt’s  and his friends were staying and handed him a letter from the president. When Keitt’s  opened the letter, he found that the president had rejected South Carolina's request." I was urged to withdraw immediately from the port of Charleston. . . I would not do so. In any possible emergency I never entertained such an idea." the president wrote.  that night a mob appeared on K Street, banging iron plates together and ringing cow bells late into the night to let South Carolinians know that Major Anderson had become "our Bob" and a hero to the people of the North overnight."

 usa.18602.d:0 "On the afternoon of December 20, 1860, with two vacancies in his cabinet, Congress in disarray, and the nation in chaos, President Buchanan left the White House in a tuxedo and a white tie. He was accompanied by his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, in a gold satin gown, her plump rose-colored face framed by chestnut hair held in place by bandages. In a carriage drawn by two gray horses, they traveled a few blocks down New York Avenue to Mrs. Parker's mansion. On this day, the president was to be best man at the wedding of Mrs. Parker's daughter to Louisiana Congressman J.E. Bouligny. When the carriage arrived at the Parker Mansion and the President and Miss Lane entered the grand foyer, they passed a group of ladies wearing gowns similar to Miss Lane's; flowing gowns laid on huge hoops, plus garlands of flowers on their heads that trailed down the gowns to the floor, making the ladies look like bells. As the ladies made way for the President and Miss Lane, two black men in black uniforms played trumpets and the slogan "Hail to the Commander-in-Chief". The mansion was transformed into a greenhouse for the occasion; swarms of live plants and shrubs filled the space between the upholstered armchairs, sofas and tables. A fountain stood in the hallway between the living rooms, covered with blooming roses and lilies brought from Florida. In the dining room, connected to the main living room, a long table of jeweled cedar and ivory was filled with roast beef and turkey, duck, chicken, fried and braised oysters, jellies, whips, preserves, and a variety of pies, cakes and puddings. On a side plank, servants were filling slender glasses with champagne. The damask curtains hanging over the tall narrow windows of the drawing room and dining room were closed; all that remained in the room were mellow gas lamps that flickered and hissed. Walking to the main living room, with crimson velvet curtains across the other end of the room, the president paused in the doorway and said a few words to the Reverend James of St. John's Church, who would be conducting the service, before he sat down heavily in an armchair just inside the door. He crossed his legs, rested one arm on the arm of the chair, bowed his head slightly to one side, and nodded for the wedding guests to enter the room and line up along the wall. When the rustle of gowns and the murmur of guests finally faded into silence, the priest stepped forward and pulled a cord, causing the velvet curtains to open and the bridal party to emerge into position behind them. The ladies in the wedding party gasped with delight and clapped their hands as the bride and groom walked to the center of the room.  suddenly, just as the bride and groom began to exchange vows, a great commotion came from the entrance hall. A group of young men in blue cocked hats and red sashes came across the room toward the wedding reception, stomping and jumping in the air in their leather riding boots, shaking hands with the ladies and applauding the backs of the gentlemen they met. Congressman Lawrence Keitt of Carolina walked at the head of the procession. As he walked to the living room door and saw the bride and groom flushed at the other end of the room, he clenched a piece of paper in his fist.  "Thank God! Thank God!" Keitt exclaimed. Reverend James held out his hand to silence the council members. "Mr. Keitt, Mr. Keitt, are you crazy?" "No, God, no! South Carolina has seceded, sir. That's the telegram!"  Keitt said, as the ladies and gentlemen in the room swarmed around him, laughing and clapping their hands.  Just then Miss Harriet Lane, who was standing alone, pushed her way out of the noisy crowd and came to the president's chair. In the time it took Keitt to gleefully read the telegram aloud, the president's rosy face turned to mush. The day he had been dreading had finally come. The eggshell had cracked. The old Union, his entire political career as a congressman, senator, cabinet minister, diplomat and president, was crumbling under his watch. Seeing the despair on her uncle's face, Miss Harriet Lane looked to the servants standing silently in the hallway, their eyes and mouths agitated. She waved at them impatiently the long white handkerchief with the ring on her index finger attached by a chain. "May we use the president's carriage?"  she said in a trembling voice. Then, as several servants hurried toward the entrance hall, she reached for her uncle's arm, and the two of them walked unnoticed out of Mrs. Parker's parlor. "

 usa.18603.t:0 "Anderson comes to Fort Sumter"
 usa.18603.d:0 "A few days later, at Charleston Harbor, a party from Major Anderson's garrison took a string of wagons out of Fort Moultrie and pulled them a quarter of a mile through the Moultrieville district and the dunes to a seawall where three two-masted schooners with barges tethered to them were located. For a few hours in the afternoon, the men loaded the boxes and luggage onto the barges. Then, when the work was done, the men went abroad to the catamaran and, with the barges following them, they drifted the catamaran into the harbor channel as the tide came in. Major Anderson had informed the Charleston harbormaster that the catamaran would carry the personal property of his soldiers' families across the harbor from Fort Moultrie to Fort Johnson. Anderson explained that he intended to use the buildings there to house his soldiers' wives and other noncombatants. The catamaran sailed across the harbor in 30 minutes and dropped anchor in front of James Island, across from the fort.  sunset, as the catamaran dropped anchor near James Island, the artillerymen still at Fort Moultrie appeared on the seawall with their officers and climbed into a string of rowboats. While a rear guard remained at the fort, the men rowed in the twilight toward Fort Sumter and through the waters of the harbor. A small paddle boat used to patrol the harbor approached within 100 yards of the rowboats and slowed its engine, but did not approach. The small flotilla continued on until they reached Fort Sumter's dock at the foot of the canyon wall. As soon as they reached the dock and began mooring their boats, the men hung bayonets on their muskets and scrambled down the river bank toward the assembly port where a group of stonemasons were resting.  As they ran, someone's angry voice rang out." What are these soldiers doing here?" The folk realized it was Anderson's men too late.  As a series of running soldiers came up to the civilians, they pushed them down the staging tunnel and through two sets of open iron gates to the parade ground. The soldiers behind them went through the tunnel and spread out to get the rest of the laborers out of the arched barracks and to protect the fort. Having done this, Major Anderson went to the parapet of the projecting wall and lit a blue light as a signal to the rear guard of Fort Moultrie. Soon after, a gun was fired, and the catamaran lying near Fort Johnson immediately raised anchor and sailed across the harbor to the wharf. As soon as the signal gun went off, the rear guard nailed the cannons covering the garrison across the harbor, broke up the gun carriages and wagons and burned them, and cut down the flagstaff. Meanwhile, at Fort Sumter, Anderson's men went to work unloading food and munitions from crates tied to barges, and stonemasons were ordered into rowboats. Then one of the catamarans got off the barge and sailed for Fort Moultrie, picking up the men left behind and taking them back to Sumter.  Throughout the movement of Anderson's men toward Fort Sumter, the Carolinians remained surprisingly quiet. Given their control of the land and sea around Fort Moultrie, they had plenty of warning that Anderson was organizing his garrison to move toward Fort Sumter. The catamarans were rented from local boat owners and the captains were Carolina men. The rowboats had to be purchased for their use, and they were positioned behind a sea wall where they could be easily observed from both land and sea. While Anderson's men were loading barges on the seawall in the afternoon, the South Carolina battery men and riflemen in the buildings of the towns surrounding the fort could easily interfere with the operation. Given that the men on the harbor patrol boats and those in the batteries and town buildings surrounding the fort had several hours of observation time, the Carolinians had to recognize early on that Fort Sumter was the target of Anderson's operation. However, they did not fire on Anderson's men and the harbor patrols did not interfere with the rowboats. They knew their small state was isolated in such an environment and unprepared to attack the armed forces of a major power like the United States. "

 usa.1492.t:0 "The situation in Indian Territory"
 usa.1492.d:0 "At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Indian Territory included much of the area now occupied by Oklahoma. Between 1830 and 1850, these groups were forcibly removed by the U.S. government from their ancestral lands in the Southeast and marched hundreds of miles westward. The migration, which became known as the "Trail of Blood and Tears," resulted in thousands of deaths. The  Cherokee Nation has been politically divided since that tumultuous period and is a prime example of a tribal people further torn apart by war. On one side is Chief John Ross, the leader who led the nation through the Trail of Tears. He has the support of nearly two-thirds of the people and has urged neutrality and national unity as separatist forces expand in and around Indian Territory. His supporters, organized under the name of the Kitova Association, supported abolitionism, but were motivated by national sovereignty and a desire for a self-determined Cherokee identity.  the other side a minority of wealthy slave-owning Cherokees who were deeply resentful of Ross and his failure to ally with the Confederacy. Their leader was the longtime leader of the Treaty Party, Stand Watie, so called because its members had illegally signed treaties forcing the Cherokees to leave their homeland despite the opposition of the majority. There had been a burning hatred between the two political factions since before the Cherokees left the Old Cherokee Nation, and when civil war broke out, it simply provided an opportunity for the fire of this ancient feud to come in, full of anger.  October 1861, Ross succumbed to mounting pressure and signed a treaty with the Confederacy promising protection, food, and other resources to the Cherokee Nation in exchange for several regiments of soldiers and access to their territory to build roads and forts. The treaty was unpopular with most Cherokees, but it allowed Ross to keep the government stable and remain in power. A few months earlier, Watie had secretly worked with the Confederacy to form a regiment, the Cherokee Cavalry, that gathered a few hundred supporters. (He went on to become a brilliant field commander and bold guerrilla leader.) After the treaty was signed, a second regiment of Cherokee cavalry was formed under the command of Ross's loyalist, Colonel John Drew, as a check on Watie's growing power and influence. At the same time, a third political force began to mobilize the "loyal" Indians, led by Creek Chief Obos Leo Hollow, who was a staunch advocate of Indian neutrality in the white man's war. Refusing to ally with the Confederacy, he led thousands of followers from several tribes, as well as runaway slaves and freedmen, into exile in Kansas, where the U.S. government promised refuge under federal control. Along the way, during the fall and winter of 1861, the group endured harsh conditions and fought off repeated attacks by Southern forces, including Watie's Cherokee cavalry. But many of the Cherokees in Drew's regiment sympathized with the loyal Indians and abandoned the Confederacy to join his side This attests to the deepening divide between pro-Confederate and pro-Confederate Indians.

 usa.1493.d:0 "As the secession movement grew, loyalty issues arose in the western half of the United States. Although California had chosen to become a free state in 1849 and was admitted to the Union in 1850, many Southerners who had migrated to California during the Gold Rush favored the separation of Southern California from Northern California as a separate slave state.  As southern sympathies grew stronger, California struggled to gain control of its state militia. To ensure the security of the more pro-Southern Democratic counties, certain militias with divided loyalties were disbanded in favor of the federal militia.  order to counter the federal militia and strengthen Confederate forces in Southern California, the secessionist Los Angeles Cavalry was created. Although the Los Angeles Cavalry was never able to rally the militia of Southern California for secession, their presence alerted the Union to Confederate tendencies in the far west of the country.  Confederate movement in the western United States, particularly in Arizona, brought about the creation of the California Column, a column of ten California companies: five companies of the First Regiment of California Volunteer Cavalry, Company B of the Second Regiment of California Volunteer Cavalry, and Company A Light Artillery of the Third United States Artillery. The California Column consisted of 1,500 men, described by Lieutenant George Pettis of the 1st California Infantry as well-trained, disciplined, and eager to demonstrate their strength. "

It was the afternoon of April 11, 1861, and waving a white flag, two staff officers of Confederate General Beauregard rowed across the bay of Charleston Harbor to Fort Sumter, carrying a written demand for surrender. The new commander of Fort Sumter, Robert Anderson, refused to accept the demand, but added: "Gentlemen, if you do not break the forts around us to pieces, we shall be starved to death in a few days, too." At 5:15 p.m., Major Anderson's reply was sent to General Beauregard, who was also informed of the unofficial words. Anderson's reply and remarks were conveyed to the Confederate authorities in Montgomery. Confederate Secretary of War L.P. Walker replied to Beauregard as follows: "Do not bombard Fort Sumter unnecessarily. If Major Anderson will state the time he indicates he will withdraw and agree that he will not use his artillery against us during that time unless our artillery is used against Fort Sumter, you are entitled to do so to avoid bloodshed. If this or its equivalent is refused, decide in your discretion the most practicable way to weaken the fort. The aide then brought a second communication to Major Anderson, in accordance with the above instructions, which reached him at 12:45 a.m. on April 12. His reply indicated that if he received no conflicting instructions or additional supplies from the Government in the meantime, he would evacuate the fort on the 15th, but he refused to agree not to fire upon the Confederates in the event of any hostile manifestation of their flag against him. Major Anderson made every effort to keep his aides until daylight, and made excuse after excuse for his delayed reply. Finally, at 3:15 a.m., he made his reply. Following their instructions, the aides read it over, found it unsatisfactory, and sent Major Anderson this notice: M Fort Sumter, South Carolina, April 12, 1861, 3:20 a.m. Sir: By authority of Brigadier General Beauregard, commanding the provisional forces of the Confederate States of America, we have the honor to inform you that he will open fire on Fort Sumter in one hour. James Chesnutt, camp assistant. Stephen Lee, Captain, Confederate States of America Army, Camp Assistant. The above note was written in a bunker at Fort Sumter, in the presence of Major Anderson and several of his officers, and on its receipt he was greatly affected. He seemed to realize the importance of the consequences, and the great responsibility of his position.

Thus, there was no law on slavery in the Territory, and, regardless of the Supreme Court's decision in Dwight Scott (1856), Congress had no power to establish or legalize slavery in the Territory, but had an obligation (Lincoln did not say what to pass) to exclude it. Of course, given the Supreme Court's ruling in Scott, there is nothing in the 1860 Constitution that supports Lincoln's position. \n Douglas' position was that the question of whether or not there was slavery in the territories should be decided by the inhabitants of those territories. His position was based on the clause in the Constitution that guaranteed the states a republican form of government. \nBreckenridge's position was that a citizen of any state had the right to remove to any territory and take any property belonging to the laws of that state, and that it was the duty of Congress to provide him with the protection necessary to enforce that right. The last two points of Breckenridge's position were as baseless as Lincoln's. \nBell's Federalist Party claimed to support the Union and the Constitution, but members of the Southern party openly expressed their interest in secession. \nBell's popularity was limited to the border states. \nLincoln's total vote in the northern states was 1,831,180. \nThe other three candidates - Douglas, Breckenridge and Bell - received a total of 2,801,810 votes. \nThe total number of votes cast for Lincoln in the Southern states was 26,439. \nThe total number of votes cast for the other three candidates was 1,264,325. \nThe total number of votes cast for Douglas in the United States was 1,296,604. \N Breckenridge received a total of 859,082 votes in the United States. \N. Bell received 646,124 votes in the United States. \nThe total number of votes for Douglas, Breckenridge and Bell in the United States was 2,801,810, and the total number of votes for Lincoln was 1,831,180. Lincoln won 180 electoral votes from this total, while all the others combined won 123. Lincoln did not receive a single vote in nearly one-third of the states, nor did he receive a single elector in the entire South. Nevertheless, the election was constitutional, legally fair, and as democratic as any that had ever been held. The tide has simply turned."

 usa.12.d:0 "On the morning of April 18, 1861, Robert Edward Lee arrived at the young Blair house on Pennsylvania Avenue, directly across from the State, War and Navy Departments, where he found the old butler waiting for him. They sat down behind the closed door. Blair explained quickly and plainly the reason for his summons to Lee. A large army, he said, would soon be called into battle to enforce federal law. The president authorized him to ask Lee if he would accept command. To command an army of 75,000 men, perhaps 100,000: the opportunity to apply everything he had learned in Mexico, to realize the highest ambitions of a soldier, to have the full support of the government, to have many of his best comrades working with him, to become a major general-all of these might come to Lee's mind in a moment, but if so, it would be only a moment. Then, his Virginia background and years of spiritual discipline stuck. He had said. If the Union is broken up and the government is disrupted, I will return to my native land and suffer with my people, and will not draw my sword against anyone except in defense. He stood there, and in that spirit, after listening to all that Blair had to say, he gave the decisive answer, which is best reflected in his own brief account of the interview. "I declined his offer to put me in command of the troops about to go to war, and stated, as frankly and politely as I could, that while I opposed secession and condemned war, I could not take part in the invasion of the Southern states. As far as Lee was concerned, that was all. He had long since instinctively decided what his duties required, and the lure of supreme command, and all that a soldier could desire, did not tempt him to hesitate, or to see if there was any way he could keep his honor and still have the honor he understood the President had given him. Blair continued to talk, hoping to convince Lee, but it was in vain. After bidding farewell to Buell, Lee went directly to Scott's office. He sensed that Scott was interested in his actions and as soon as he arrived, he told him of Buell's offer and his answer. "Lee," Scott said, deeply moved, "I fear you have made the greatest mistake of your life, and there are times when every officer in the United States should fully define the goal he wants to pursue and express it openly and honestly. No one should remain in the employ of the government without actively working". And again: I think you'll go with the others. If you intend to resign, you should do so immediately: your attitude now is ambiguous. Less than 15 hours after Lee received positive news of Virginia's withdrawal from the Union, Robert E. Lee wrote two letters to the Secretary of War and General Scott to resign from his position in the U.S. Army. Arlington, Washington City, April 20, 1861 Lieutenant General Winfield Scott U.S. Army Command General. Since my interview with you on the 18th instant, I have felt that I should not retain any position in the army. I do not feel that I should retain any position in the Army. Therefore, I offer my resignation and ask for your recommendation to accept it. I would have tendered my resignation at once if it had not been a painful struggle to leave the country to which I have devoted the best years of my life and all my abilities. In more than a quarter of a century, I have experienced only the kindness of my superiors and the most cordial friendship from my comrades. I have never been so kind and considerate to any general as you were, and I have always eagerly hoped for your approval. I shall enter the grave with the most grateful memories of your kind consideration, and your name and fame will always be dear to me. I shall never draw my sword again, except in defense of my country. Please accept any more wishes and continue to maintain your happiness and prosperity, believe me. Yours most faithfully, R. E. Lee"

At the outbreak of the Civil War, 19 of the 36 officers of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry resigned, including Thomas' three superiors, Albert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee and William J. Hardee. When Governor John Letcher of Virginia, his home state, offered him the position of Chief of Ordnance of Virginia, he declined because to accept would have meant resigning in the U.S. Army and joining the state of Virginia and the future Confederacy. In a letter to Governor John Letcher he wrote; "I do not wish to leave the United States Army, so long as it is honorable for me to remain in it." Virginia was then in a crisis of secession, and Thomas went on to write, "It is my purpose to remain in the army so long as my native Virginia remains in the Union, unless called upon to perform duties contrary to honor and humanity. Despite his sympathies for Virginia, Thomas remained in the service of the Union when the Civil War broke out. After the surrender of Fort Sumter at Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, on April 14, he was drafted back into military service and immediately signed up. Thomas was promptly promoted to lieutenant colonel ( April 25, 1861, succeeding Robert Lee) and colonel ( May 3, succeeding Albert Sidney Johnston) in the regular army, and brigadier general of volunteers (August 17)."

 usa.15.t:0 "Scenes from East Tennessee"
 usa.15.d:0 "In 1861, throughout East Tennessee, secession was an unpopular idea. There were few slaves in the eastern third of the state. Agriculture was not as important here in all of East Tennessee, especially in Scott County, as it was further west. People here were largely self-sufficient, using their family farms to keep food on the table and clothes on their children's backs. Even though slaves were considered a necessity, most Scott Countians could not afford them. Secession was already inevitable in much of the South when Lincoln won 18 states and 39% of the popular vote in the presidential election, and was gaining momentum in Tennessee. It was after Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion in South Carolina that Tennesseans, at the behest of Governor Isham Harris, began to strongly consider secession from the Union. In February 1861, Tennesseans balked at Harris's proposal and sided with Washington, rejecting secession by a vote of 68,282-59449. The Scott County vote was decisive. 93 percent opposed secession, and the final result in Huntsville was 385-29. Harris, from pro-slavery West Tennessee, was not deterred by the failed vote. After all, Harris had campaigned against the Whigs' anti-slavery proposals as early as the 1840s and had been urging secession before Lincoln's election. When he endorsed Breckenridge in the 1860 election, Harris warned that if Lincoln was elected, "the reckless fanatics of the North will demand that Tennessee consider secession. Lincoln had not even been declared president until Harris called the first special session of the state legislature in January 1861. Even as the secession vote failed the following month, a war was heating up within the state. Many of the state's newspapers railed against Harris; one in Knoxville accused him of being a despot, and one in Huntington even called for his death by hanging. In the end, however, the battle would be won by Harris. With secession and civil war looming, the residents of Scott County may have been deeply isolated, but they defiantly remained in the Union. On June 4, 1861, future U.S. President Andrew Johnson visited Huntsville as part of a tour of villages north of Cumberland Gap, designed to drum up anti-secession support. As Johnson spoke on the front steps of the old Scott County Courthouse, the crowd listened in rapt attention. Four days later, Scott County voted against secession by the widest margin of any county in the state - 521-19. Only 3.6 percent of voters here wanted to leave the union. Morgan County voted 630-50 and Fentress County 651-128. It has been written that in 1861, only three Scott County families favored secession, and legend has it that a man from one of these families jumped into the air and shouted, "If I lived in hell, I'd fight for the devil! as a declaration of his loyalty to the South. East Tennesseans were outraged by the state's secession vote. Political leaders in the area first claimed the vote was fraudulent, then gathered in Greenville for a meeting where they petitioned Governor Harris to allow the eastern part of the state to secede and form a state of its own. Harris refused, and in response, he sent troops into East Tennessee under the command of Felix K. Zollicoffer to suppress any attempt at rebellion that might arise. Interestingly, Zollicoffer, a newspaper editor-turned-politician and former Whig, opposed Tennessee's secession from the Union and had served on a peace conference in Washington to try to avert the looming war. However, when Governor Harris ordered the arrest of any pro-Confederate leaders in East Tennessee late in 1861, it was Zollicoffer who was at the helm. Perhaps the residents of Scott County were unaware of Governor Harris's show of force. Maybe they just don't care. But when word reached the state that it had seceded from the Union, Scott Countians were outraged. Just days after the Greenville Convention's failed effort to secede from the state, the Scott County Court held a special session in Huntsville and passed a proclamation declaring itself a free and independent state, and an old farmer stood up at the special court session and said, "If Tennessee can secede from the Union, then Scott County can secede from Tennessee.

 usa.1401.d:0 "At that time, there was a fairly strong state militia reserve unit at Camp Jackson outside of St. Louis. No doubt it was Governor Claiborne Jackson's plan to use this force to take over the Confederate armory as well as St. Louis. Why this was not done later, however, I do not know. At that time, the arms depot was probably manned by only two companies of troops, commanded by Captain. Lyon. Had not the Hon. F. P. Blair acted in time, I believe that St. Louis would have fallen into the hands of the rebels, and with it the arms depot and all the arms it contained would have been seized by the enemy. Blair was at the head of the United States Federal forces stationed in St. Louis in 1861. At the time, no branch of Missouri government would have agreed to raise troops or appoint officers to protect U.S. property, but it appears that Buell received some sort of authorization from the president to raise troops in Missouri and send them to serve in the federal army. Eventually, he did raise a regiment of troops, of which he made himself colonel. Within this force, Blair took orders from Captain Lyon to place himself and the regiment he had raised under Lyon's command. It was privately discussed that this strengthening of Lyons was an attempt to take over Camp Jackson and take the militia reserves. In the morning, I went to the armory to see the troops depart. I knew Lyons from West Point, and then served together in the Army. I had heard some of his campaign speeches in the 1858 election, but had never spoken to him. When the troops came out of the armory walls, Blair was on his horse ordering them to march in formation. I went up to him, introduced myself, talked to him for a while, and offered him my sympathy for the operation. This was my first official acquaintance with the Hon. F. P. Buell, who was later promoted to the rank of Major General. Without a shot being fired, Jackson's battalion was forced to surrender, and the prisoners were taken to the armory. Up to this time, the enemy forces in St. Louis had been bold and unconcerned, while the Confederates were quiet and calm, but bold and resolute. The Federals also had a meeting place somewhere in the city, but I don't know where it was, and I doubt if they had the guts to put their flag out in the open against the enemy. When news of the capture of Camp Jackson reached the city, the situation changed. The Unionists became rampant, and they began to act provocatively. They gradually lost their patience. They began to express their patriotic feelings openly: they began to lose patience with all disrespectful words and actions of the Union. The separatists were silent, but a pent-up anger was building up in their chests, because they had been the ones who had been dominating. The Federals ordered the rebels to tear down the flag of their headquarters on Pine Street. It was as if the Unionist were giving orders to their subordinates. The flag was torn down. Since then, no rebel flag has been raised in St. Louis."

At the time, there was no direct rail connection between the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad's President Street Station and the Baltimore Ohio Railroad's Camden Station (ten blocks west) due to regulations prohibiting the use of steam locomotives in the inner city and the lack of Federal stations at the time. Train cars interchanging between the two stations had to be pulled by horses along Pratt Street. As the soldiers were transferring between the stations, a mob of secessionists and Southern sympathizers attacked the train and blocked the route. When it became clear that they could no longer ride forward, the troops disembarked and marched through the city in formation. The mob followed the soldiers, breaking store windows and causing damage until they finally held off the troops. Several soldiers were so frightened by the situation that they had to open fire, and a great confusion began between the soldiers, the violent mob and the Baltimore police, and finally the soldiers arrived at Camden Station while the police held the crowd in front of them. The mob seized much of their equipment, including the instruments of their marching band.Four soldiers (Corporal Sumner Needle of the First Squad and Luther C. Ladd, Charles Taylor, and AddisonWhitney of the Fourth Squad) and 12 civilians were killed in the riot The mob seized much of their equipment, including the instruments of their marching band.

Needham is buried in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Ladd; Taylor and Whitney are buried in Lowell, Massachusetts. Because of the riots in Baltimore and the Southern sympathies of much of the city's population, the Baltimore Steamship Charter Company on the same day refused a request from the federal government to transport federal troops to relieve the besieged federal naval dock facilities at Portsmouth, Virginia. In Maryland's largest city, clashes between pro-Southern civilians and Union troops led to the Baltimore riots, the first bloodshed of the Civil War.

A detachment of Federal Government troops under my command has occupied the city of Baltimore for the purpose, among others, of enforcing respect for and obedience to the laws, as well as the laws of the State - if required by the civil authorities - as well as the laws of the United States. To prove that the federal government accepts the fact that the city and all its bona fide inhabitants are loyal to the Union and the Constitution, and should be so regarded and treated by all. Therefore, in order to prevent all misunderstandings as to the purposes of the government, and to quell all unfounded, false and inflammatory rumors. In order to relieve all apprehensions, if any, of the good-hearted of the community, and to make it thoroughly clear to all traitors and their aiders and abettors, that the rebellion must cease, I hereby, by authority of the commanding officer of the Department of Annapolis, of which Baltimore is a part, do hereby order and declare that the lawful occupation or business of any loyal and good-hearted citizen will not be interfered with. That the men under my command will not interfere with private property, nor permit others to interfere with private property, except such property as may be used to aid and comfort those in rebellion against the government, whether here or elsewhere, and that all such property, arms of war, and things suitable to aid and support the rebellion, will be seized and confiscated. Therefore, all manufacturers of arms and munitions are hereby requested to report to me immediately, so that the legality of their profession may be known and understood, and any misunderstanding of their conduct avoided. The shipment of articles from the cities to the rebels for the purpose of aiding and supporting the troops in the field will not be permitted, and the fact of such shipment will, after the issuance of this proclamation, be considered evidence of the unlawful intent of the consignor, and will subject the goods to seizure and confiscation. The Government is ready to receive all such stores and supplies, and will immediately arrange for the conclusion of contracts, in the hope that the owners and manufacturers of such equipment and clothing, munitions and supplies will keep in touch with the Commissar, so that their workshops may be used for loyal purposes, and the artisans of the city may resume and carry on their lucrative occupations. The acting assistant quartermaster and subsistence commissioner of the United States stationed here has been directed to furnish 40,000 rations for the use of the United States troops at a fair price, and further supplies will be drawn from the full capacity of the city if the patriotic and loyal people choose to furnish them.

No flag, banner, military flag, or device of the so-called Confederate States or any of them will be permitted to be raised or displayed in this Department, and the display of any of them by persons with ill intent will be taken as evidence of giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the State. To make it clearer, the United States government relied more on the loyalty, patriotism, and zeal of the good citizens of Baltimore and vicinity than on any show of force designed to intimidate them into obedience to the law, which the government had no doubt they would obey out of inherent respect and love of order. The commander brought to the city thousands of troops from the neighboring districts, which might be immediately concentrated here, but scarcely more than an ordinary guard, and until it failed, he would continue to rely on the loyalty and patriotism of the citizens of Maryland, which had never been found wanting in the government's hour of need. The general in command desires that in this branch of his service all citizens shall be as friends and brothers, who have a common purpose, a common loyalty and a common country. If there is any violation of the laws by the troops under his command, or any unruly and un-soldier-like conduct, or any interference with private property, he wishes it to be reported to him immediately, with the assurance that if any soldier forgets himself and violates those laws which he has sworn to defend and enforce, he will be punished with the severest penalties. The General trusts that if the recommendations and requirements of this proclamation are faithfully carried out with the cooperation of all good and Union loving citizens, and peace and tranquility and the certainty of future peace and tranquility are restored, commerce will resume its accustomed channels, trade will replace dullness and inactivity, and efficient labor will replace idleness, and Baltimore will actually become what she deserves, ranking high among the commercial cities of the country.

Under these circumstances, of course my functions are terminated here. It has seemed to me proper, however, that I should appear in the Senate to announce that fact to my associates, and I will say but very little more. The occasion does not invite me to go into argument; and my physical condition would not permit me to do so if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become me to say something on the part of the State I here represent, on an occasion so solemn as this. It is known to Senators who have served with me here, that I have for many years advocated, as an essential attribute of State sovereignty, the right of a State to secede from the Union. Therefore, if I had not believed there was justifiable cause; if I had thought that Mississippi was acting without sufficient provocation, or without an existing necessity, I should still, under my theory of the Government, because of my allegiance to the State of which I am a citizen, have been bound by her action."

The senator had to draw his pistol to defend himself. Although Confederate sympathies were strong in the mountains of East Tennessee, Johnson's hometown of Greenville, he found Confederate flags flying all over the town. Tennessee had enough Union sympathizers to make efforts to call a state convention for secession fail, but after the firing on Fort Sumter, sentiment in the state shifted more toward the South. To avoid arrest, Johnson left Tennessee and returned to the Senate. As the only Southern senator to remain loyal to the Union after his state seceded, Johnson became a hero to the North. As the leader of the War Democrats, he denounced the Peace Democrats and defended President Lincoln's use of executive power in wartime. "I say, let the fighting go on, it is the cause of liberty.

 usa.200.d:0 "When the Virginia General Assembly voted to pass the Ordinance of Secession on April 17, 1861, mass meetings against secession were held in northwest Virginia. Francis H. Pierpont actively participated in these meetings and in the Wheeling Convention of May 13, 1861, where he represented Marion County. The meeting voted to defy the secession convention. Delegates from the western counties of Virginia met in Wheeling for the second time since the Civil War began. The second Wheeling Convention was held on June 11, 1861, and two days later, on June 13, John Carlisle, a delegate from Harrison County, introduced the Declaration of the People of Virginia, a document that characterized the seceding government of Richmond as illegal. Carlyle's document also called for the reorganization of Virginia's government, since all state agencies had been abandoned with the start of the war. The declaration stated that it sought to subvert the Union established by Washington and his countrymen in the purer days of the Republic, which had brought unparalleled prosperity to every class of citizens and every part of the country. It sought to transfer the loyalty of the people to an illegal union of rebellious states, and to demand their obedience to its pretended edicts and decrees. It sought to place the entire military forces and operations of the Union under the control and direction of this alliance, for offensive and defensive purposes. In conjunction with the state administrations, it exercised a reign of terror wherever their usurped power reached, with the aim of suppressing the free expression of the will of the people and making a mockery and fraud of elections. The same group, even before the adoption of the pretended decree of secession, waged war by seizing and appropriating the property of the federal government and by organizing and mobilizing armies with the avowed purpose of seizing or destroying the federal capitol. They sought to bring the allegiance of the American people into direct conflict with their subordinate allegiance to the states, thus making obedience to their pretended decrees a rebellion against the former. We, therefore, the delegates, assembled here to devise measures and act for the safety and welfare of the loyal citizens of Virginia, have considered these circumstances with each other, and see with great concern that unless some regular and proper remedy be speedily taken, this once happy commonwealth must be reduced to this deplorable condition, and appeal to the supreme ruler of the universe to assure us that our intentions are right. And hereby, in the name and on behalf of the good people of Virginia, do solemnly declare that in order to preserve their dearest rights and liberties, and the security of their persons and property, there is an urgent necessity for the reorganization of the government of the Union, and that all acts of the said Convention and Executive Department], designed to separate the Union from the United States, or to levy and prosecute war against the United States, are without authority and void. The offices of all those who had supported the broadness of the said Convention and Executive Department, whether legislative, executive or judicial, were removed. On June 20, 1861, Pierpont was elected governor of the restored government of Virginia, which was recognized by President Lincoln. As governor of the restored government of Virginia at Wheeling, Pierpont concentrated on raising regiments and commissioning officers for the Union cause. The Senate passed the bill to admit West Virginia on July 14, 1862, and the House of Delegates passed it on December 10, 1862. At Pierpont's instigation, President Lincoln signed the bill creating the state. It was not until June 20, 1863, that West Virginia was officially admitted to the Union. Arthur Borman became the first governor of the new state, and Pierpont continued to serve as governor of Virginia (including the counties of Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun, Accomack, Northampton, and Norfolk) from the new capital of Alexandria. nArthur Borman became the first governor of the new state, and Pierpont continued to serve as governor of Virginia (including the counties of Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun, Accomack, Northampton, and Norfolk) from Alexandria's new capital."

 usa.1404.d:0 "Harper's Weekly Saturday, August 1, 1863. The Riots. When we wrote this article last week, the riots in New York were just beginning, and there was some doubt as to how far they might extend and where they would culminate. However, we see no reason to change the views we expressed in the last issue of the magazine. The outbreak was the natural result of a pernicious doctrine widely spread among the ignorant and excited population of a large city; the only possible way to deal with it was a severe and bloody repression. Had the mob attacked with grapes and shells on Monday, when the first riot took place, lives and property could have been saved. If resistance had been more general and bloodshed more frequent than on Thursday, the city would have enjoyed a longer period of peace and tranquility than we can now hope for.It is as useless to argue now about the $300 clause in the Enrollment Act as it is to argue about the abstract right of secession. If resistance had been more general and bloodshed more frequent than on Thursday, the city would have enjoyed peace and tranquility longer than we can now hope to. It is as useless to argue now about the $300 clause in the Enrollment Act as it is to argue about the abstract right of secession. Before Monday night, the riots had gone far beyond the issue of the draft. Within an hour of the destruction of the provost's office, the rioters had completely forgotten about the $300 issue and were preoccupied with their nefarious plans for murder, arson and pillage. Not to escape the draft, Negro orphanages were burned; private homes were ransacked; harmless Negroes were beaten, maimed and murdered; Brooks' clothing store and several other small stores were looted; private citizens were openly robbed, beaten and maimed in the public streets; and the nation's metropolis was kept in agonizing terror and suspense for nearly a week. For these atrocities, the conscription was only an excuse; the cause was the natural unrest of a heterogeneous population, which was aggravated by the vile teachings of despicable politicians and their newspaper establishment. Some newspapers dwelled on the fact that the rioters were all Irish, and therefore believed that our troubles came from Irish perversions. Rioting is not a peculiarly Irish feature: it is common to the mobs of all nations. In this city, in our working class, the Irish element largely surpasses all others, and if the people act as a populace, the Irish will naturally figure prominently in it. Moreover, because of the limited educational opportunities enjoyed by the Irish in their own country, when they come here they are more easily misled by charlatans and made the tools of politicians than are the Germans or people of other races. Likewise, the Celtic impulse drove him to the forefront of every outburst, whether it was for good or ill will. But it must be remembered, as Archbishop Hughes has said, that the riots of last week brought disgrace to the name of the Irish, who in many quarters of the city were firm friends of law and order in the recent riots; who helped to save from the rioters the colored orphans in the asylum; that a large proportion of the policemen who behaved most gallantly during the whole riot were Irish; that the Roman Catholic clergy exerted their influence on the law; perhaps the harshest condemnation of the riots was written by an Irishman - James T. Brady."

 usa.1406.t:0 "New York Draft Riots（II）"
 usa.1406.d:0 "It is important that this riot should teach us something more useful than the revival of "know-nothing" prejudice. We should learn from it what we should have known before, but communities and individuals can learn nothing but from experience - riots are natural and inevitable diseases of big cities, epidemics, like chicken pox and cholera, which must be dealt with scientifically, based on logical principles and the light of much experience. In the old cities, where the authorities knew how to deal with riots, and used grapes and cans at once, they never happened twice in a generation, and one lesson was enough for the most hot-blooded rioters; in other places, with less vigorous advice, the disease was checked and concealed for a time, only to break out again in intervals of months or years. The secret, of course, was that by the former method the people were thoroughly instilled with a belief in the power of the authorities, and in their ability and determination to suppress riots at all costs-a lesson for life; while in the latter case the half-suppressed rioters were allowed to go home with a feeling that they might be the strong ones after all, and the government the weak ones. Thus, in times of peace and order, the baton was the appropriate weapon for the police, while in times of riot, the rifle and howitzer were the only benevolent weapons. In suppressing riots, it is very important that rioters should not have any excuse to blame their opponents for being foreigners or strangers. If it were true that the problem was between "the people" and "American soldiers," as was stated in the recent riots, then the rioters would have fought harder than they did because they knew that their opponents were as much "the people" as they were. As everyone can see, sending troops from New England or Pennsylvania to quell the riots in New York would have bad repercussions. But if we are to quell our own riots, citizens interested in maintaining peace and order must be willing to offer their services. It is true to say that the citizens of New York have shown little enthusiasm in answering the call of the mayor and the governor to recruit volunteers to quell the recent riots. Of the 400 muskets lying idle in the armory of the 37th Regiment, only 80 were found ready to be carried, despite urgent appeals for recruits by both the authorities and the officers of the regiment. We can never hope to keep the peace unless we are prepared to move out in an emergency and fight. There is a possibility of further disturbances. In New York City, as in the rest of the country, it is clear that the draft will proceed at all costs. The city council might pay $300 for the poor who were drafted; although many doubted that the city had the authority to do so, and that the distribution of the money would inevitably give rise to serious fraud. But this has nothing to do with the government. The government's job was first to enforce the laws, in New York as elsewhere; and second to preserve the Union, which could not be done without a draft to fill the depleted army. There were many ways in which mechanics and workers could provide each other with the security of a draft without violating the law by combining together. If they chose to do so, they would have the help of everyone who had the money to do so. But if there were any more burning and ransacking of houses and murder of Negroes - any more attempts to put the people of New York above the law - the consequences would be so terrible that mothers would shudder to tell this story to their children in the years to come."

Fearing that the Confederacy would take control of the facility, shipyard commander Charles Stewart McCauley ordered the shipyard to be burned on April 21, 1861. In fact, Confederate troops did take over the shipyard, and did so without armed conflict, through an elaborate ruse by civilian railroad builder William Mahone (then president of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad and soon to become a prominent Confederate officer). He bluffed the Confederates into abandoning the Portsmouth shipyards by running a passenger train into Norfolk, making loud noises and whistles, then sending it back west more quietly, and then running the same train back again, creating the illusion of a large number of troops arriving (and barely out of sight) for the Union troops listening across the Elizabeth River at Portsmouth. The occupation of the shipyards put a great deal of war material in the hands of the Confederates. 1,195 heavy guns were taken to defend the Confederacy and were used in many areas from Hampton Roads all the way to Fort Donelson, Tennessee, Port Hudson, and Fort DeRussy, Louisiana. Federal troops retreated across Hampton Roads to Fort Monroe, the only land in the area still under Union control."

The Democrats nominated General George McClellan, who had been removed from office by Lincoln. McClellan ran on an anti-Lincoln and anti-Emancipation Proclamation platform, and reserved the possibility of negotiating a peace with the South. As the election approached, Union victories on the battlefield helped propel Lincoln to victory. He announced the election results as a mandate for him to continue to fight for an unconditional victory and a constitutional amendment to end slavery. There were some who argued that an election should not be held, not in the midst of a bloody internecine war. He said that if the rebellion could force us to abandon or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have conquered and ruined us. Therefore, elections are to be held. In thirty years, with the exception of Andrew Jackson, no president has run for or won a second term. In fact, it became unseemly to even try. But everyone is satisfied that Lincoln, in a reversal of this thirty-year tradition, will run for re-election again."

Even Lincoln expected McClellan to win. The Confederacy was well aware of the Union's discontent. Many believed that if Confederate troops could hold out until the election was over, negotiations for U.S. recognition of Confederate independence might begin."

Harney (commander of the Western Department of the U.S. Army) and Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Guard, at the beginning of the American Civil War. The truce was intended to prevent the outbreak of violence in Missouri during the Camp Jackson incident, when Union troops under the command of Captain Nathaniel Lyon captured Missouri militia assembled on the outskirts of St. Louis. As Lyon led the captured militiamen through the crowd to the St. Louis Arsenal, a civilian riot broke out. Soldiers fired into the crowd, killing several people. After the riot, the Missouri legislature enacted the governor's "military bill" replacing the Missouri militia with the new Missouri State Guard. The governor appointed Sterling Price as major general and commander of the state guard. General Harney left St. Louis during the Camp Jackson incident. Upon his return, he met with Price and signed a joint statement "for the purpose of removing misunderstandings and relieving public excitement" with the goal of "restoring peace and good order to the people of this state, subject to the laws of the general and state governments." The Price-Harney truce left federal troops in charge of order in the St. Louis area and state troops in charge of order in the rest of the state. Under the terms of the truce, as Harney understood it, the agreement obligated the Missouri State Guard to protect Missouri's Unionists from harassment and to hold the state for the Union. Haney also told Price that some provisions in Missouri's recently enacted "military bill" would have to be amended to eliminate potential conflicts with the federal government's legal authority. The truce immediately drew the ire of various Missouri Federalists (including politically powerful Congressman Frank Blair), who lobbied President Lincoln and the War Department to remove Haney from command. Faced with reports of mistreatment of Missouri Federalists and ongoing negotiations between Governor Jackson and the federal government, Lincoln approved the replacement of Haney as commander of the Western District by the newly promoted Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. The change of command occurred on May 30. Haney was recognized as a legalistic and cautious Federalist, while Lyon was an outspoken abolitionist with longstanding ties to several radical Federalist groups in Missouri."

 #Lincoln Assassination
 usa.01865.t:0 "Playbill from Ford's Theatre"
 usa.01865.d:0 "Ford's Theatre, Friday night, April 14, 1865. Benefit! The last night of Miss Laura Keene's performance! Tom Taylor's famous wacky comedy; Our American Cousin. Act I in the drawing room of Trenchard Hall, where the servants comment on their employer's dire financial situation. Florence Trenchard, an aristocratic young beauty, is in love with Lieutenant Harry Vernon of the Royal Navy, but she cannot marry him until he rises to a higher rank. She receives a letter from her brother Ned, who is currently in America. Ned meets some rustic cousins from a branch of the family that emigrated to America two centuries ago. They told Ned that great-uncle Mark Trenchard had found these cousins in Brattleboro, Vermont, after he had angrily disinherited his children and left England years earlier. He moved in with them and eventually allowed one of his sons, Asa, to inherit his property in England. Asa is now on a boat to England to claim his inheritance. Asa was noisy and vulgar, but honest and straightforward and colorful. The Trenchard family in England was both amused and shocked by the Vermont cousin. The estate's agent, Richard Coyle, met with Sir Edward Trenchard (Florence's father) and told the baronet that unless they could pay Coyle's debts, the family would face bankruptcy. Quoyle conceals evidence that the loan has long been repaid by Sir Edward's late father. Quoyle suggests that the loan will be satisfied if he can marry Florence, who loathes him. Meanwhile, Asa and the housekeeper, Binnie, try to understand each other in unfamiliar ways, and Asa tries to understand what the purpose of the shower is, which he takes while fully clothed. In the second act Mrs. Monchendon lives at Trenchard Manor. She advises her daughter Augusta to pay more attention to this presumably wealthy Vermont "wild man. Meanwhile, her other daughter Georgina is courting an imbecile aristocrat named Dundee by feigning illness. Florence's old governess, the unhappy alcoholic Abe Murcott, warns her that Coyle intends to marry her. Asa overhears the news and offers Florence her help. Murcott, Coyle's clerk, finds evidence of a loan paid to Coyle by Florence's late grandfather. Florence and Asa visit her cousin, Mary Meredith. Mary was the granddaughter of Mark Trenchard Sr. who had left his estate to Asa. Mary was very poor and had grown up as a humble dairymaid. Asa did not care about her social status and was attracted to her. Florence could not bear to tell Marie that her grandfather's estate had been left to Asa. Florence tells Asa that she is in love with Harry and that he needs a good assignment on a ship. Asa uses his countryman's wisdom to convince Dundreary to help Harry get a boat. Meanwhile, Coyle has been out of practice and the bailiffs arrive at Trenchard Hall. In the third act at the dairy, Asa tells Mary about her grandfather in America, but he fudges the end of the story: he says that Mark Trenchard Sr. changed his mind about disinheriting the English children and burned his will. Asa promptly burned the will himself, under the pretext of lighting a cigar. Florence discovers this and points it out to Mary, saying "It means he's a real hero, and he loves you, you little rascal." Meanwhile, Mrs. Monchendon still wants Asa to propose to Augusta. Augusta and Mrs. Monchessington are quite rude when Asa tells them that Mark Trenchard has left Mary his fortune, but Asa stands up for himself. Asa asks Mary to marry him, and is gladly accepted. He then infiltrates Coyle's office with Murcott and retrieves the documents showing that the debt has been paid. Asa confronts Quoyle, insisting that Quoyle must pay Sir Edward's other debts with his undoubtedly ill-gotten gains and apologize to Florence for trying to force her into marriage. He also demands that Coyle resign as steward of Trenchard Hall and that Murcott become steward instead. Murcott is so pleased that he vows to stop drinking. Quoyle has no choice but to do this. Florence married Harry, Dundry married Georgina, Augusta married an old flame. Even the servants got married."

 usa.01866.d:0 "Good Friday, April 14, 1865, must have been one of Abraham Lincoln's happiest days. On that morning, he had a leisurely breakfast accompanied by his son Robert, who had just arrived in Washington after working on General Grant's staff." Well, my son, you have returned safely from the front," Lincoln said." The war is now over, and we will soon be at peace with the brave men who fought against us." He urged Robert to "lay aside" his uniform and complete his education, perhaps in preparation for a career in law. As his father imparted his advice, Mary Lincoln's seamstress, Elizabeth Keckley, observed that "his face was more cheerful than [she] had seen in a long time." At 11 a.m., Grant arrived at the White House for a regularly scheduled Friday cabinet meeting. Lincoln told Grant not to worry. He predicted that news would soon come, "for he had the usual dream last night, which he has had before almost every great and important event in the war." Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles asked him to describe the dream. Lincoln turned to him and said that the dream concerned the affairs of the Secretary of the Navy: water, that he seemed to be on some strange and indescribable vessel, that he was moving with great speed toward an uncertain coast; that he had this dream before the battles of Fort Sumter, Bull Creek, Antietam, Gettysburg, Stone River, Vicksburg, Wilmington, etc." Grant said that not all of these great events were victorious, but Lincoln still hoped that this one would be favorable.The complexity of reestablishing law and order in the Southern states dominated the conversation. Not all of these great events were victorious, Grant said, but Lincoln still hoped that this one would be favorable. The complexity of re-establishing law and order in the Southern states dominated the conversation. A few days earlier, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had drafted a plan to impose a temporary military government in Virginia and North Carolina until civilian rule was restored." Lincoln insinuated the document," Stanton later recalled, "went into his room, took it out, and asked me to read it." General discussion showed that most cabinet members were in favor, although Wells and Postmaster General William Dennison opposed the idea of eliminating state lines by combining two different states into one military department. Recognizing the validity of this objection, Lincoln asked Stanton to revise his plan to apply it to two different states. Lincoln said that "he thought it providential that this great rebellion should be crushed when Congress adjourned," because he and the cabinet were more likely to "accomplish more without them than with them" in the matter of Reconstruction. He noted that "there are some in Congress who, even if their motives are good, are impractical, and who possess feelings of hatred and revenge in which he has no sympathy and in which he cannot participate. He hoped that at the end of the war there would be no persecution, no bloody reprisals". As for the rebel leaders, Lincoln reaffirmed his determination not to commit further violence." While their continued presence on American soil could prove troublesome, he preferred to "frighten them out of this country, open the gates, lower the fences, and frighten them away." To illustrate his point, he shook "his hand, as if to frighten the sheep" and said, "Enough lives have been sacrificed. If we expect harmony and union, we must extinguish our resentment." After theCabinet meeting, Stanton walked down the stairs with Attorney General James and said, "If we expect harmony and union, we must extinguish our resentment." After the cabinet meeting, Stanton walked down the stairs with Attorney General James Speed." Doesn't our commander-in-chief look grand today?" Stanton asked. Years later, Speed remembered firmly "Lincoln's personal appearance that day," with "his face cleanly shaven, his clothes well brushed, his hair and beard neatly combed," a marked contrast to his usual rumpled appearance. Stanton later wrote that Lincoln seemed "more cheerful and happy" than at any previous cabinet meeting, and that he was excited by "the near prospect of a firm and lasting peace at home and abroad." Throughout the discussion, Stanton recalled, Lincoln "spoke kindly of General Lee and others in the Confederacy" and "manifestly displayed the kindness and humanity of his character, and the spirit of gentleness and forbearance which made him so prominent.""

 usa.01867.t:0 "A dinner to remember forever"
 usa.01867.d:0 "Later that day, Lincoln put his lenient policy toward the rebel leaders into effect. Stanton received information at the War Department that Jacob Thompson, "an apparent secessionist," was on his way to Portland, Maine, where a steamer was waiting to take him to England. Thompson had organized a series of troublesome cross-border raids from Canada that left Stanton with little sympathy for the Southern marauder. Upon reading the telegram, Stanton did not hesitate." Arrest him!" He ordered Assistant Secretary Charles Dana. However, when Dana was about to leave the room, Stanton called him back. No, wait; better go over and see the president." Dana found him in Lincoln's office." Hello, Dana!" Lincoln greeted him." What's going on?" Dana described the situation, explaining that Stanton wanted to arrest Thompson, but thought he should "submit" the issue to Lincoln first." Well," Lincoln said, "no, I'd rather not. When you catch an elephant by the hind legs and it's trying to run away, it's better to let it run away." Mary Lincoln's recollection of her husband's infectious joy that day matched that of his inner circle. She had never seen Lincoln so "cheerful," she told the painter Frances Carpenter, "and his manners were even playful. At three o'clock in the afternoon he went out with me in an open carriage, and as we were setting out I asked him if anyone would accompany us, to which he promptly replied, "No, I prefer to ride by myself today. During the drive he was so happy that I said to him with a smile, 'My dear husband, your great joy almost amazes me,' to which he replied, 'I can feel the same, Mary, I think this day, the war is over, and then added, 'We both, must be happier in the future - between the war and the loss of Between the war and the loss of our dear Willie, we are, both of us, already very miserable." As the carriage pulled up to the Navy Yard, Mary recalled, "he talked of his old home in Springfield and recalled his early life, his little brown cottage, the law office, the courtroom, the green bag containing his briefs and legal papers, and his adventures on tour." They have come an unimaginable distance together since they first danced in Springfield a quarter century ago. Over the years, they supported each other, enraged each other, and shared a love of family, politics, poetry and theater. After the death of their son Willie, Mary fell into a depression that greatly increased Lincoln's burden, and the terrible strain of war further distorted their relationship. His intense focus on presidential duties often left her feeling abandoned and resentful. Now, with the war over and time bringing solace to their grief, the Lincolns could plan a happier future. They hoped one day to travel to Europe and the Holy Land, over the Rocky Mountains to California, and back home to Illinois, where their lives would begin. As the carriage approached the White House, Lincoln saw a group of old friends, including Illinois Governor Richard Oglesby, preparing to leave." Come back, boys, come back," he said to them, relishing the easy company of his friends. They stayed for a while, Oglesby recalled." Lincoln started reading some humorous books; I think it was 'John Phoenix' who wrote them. They kept asking him to come to dinner. He promised each time he would go, but would keep reading the book. Finally, he was given a mandatory order that he had to come to dinner right away. An early dinner was necessary because the Lincolns planned to see Laura Keene in Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre that evening. After dinner, the president met with journalist Noah Brooks, Massachusetts Congressman George Ashmun and House Speaker Schuyler Colfax, who would soon depart for California." How I wish I could make that trip!" Lincoln said to Colfax, "but public duty has locked me in, and I can only envy you your pleasure." The president invited Colfax to go to the theater with him that night, but Colfax had too many reservations. To Brooks, Lincoln was "hopeful and uplifted by the state of the country, and particularly cheered by the prospect before us." His parting words, Brooks recalled, focused on the nation's economic prospects." Grant believed that we could reduce the cost of our Army establishment by at least half a million a day, and that this, together with a reduction in naval expenditures, would soon reduce our national debt to something like acceptable proportions, and bring our national debt to the same level as gold, or nearly so.""

 usa.01868.d:0 "Speaker Colfax was one of several people who declined the Lincolns' invitation to the theater that night. The morning edition of the National Republic had announced that the Grants would sit in the presidential box with the Lincolns that night, but Julia Grant was so intent on visiting their children in New Jersey that Grant asked to be excused. The Stantons also refused. Stanton considered the theater a silly pastime and, more importantly, a dangerous one. He had been fighting a losing battle for months to keep the president out of such public places, and he felt that his presence would only put him in unnecessary danger. Earlier that day, "unwilling to encourage the theater project," Stanton had refused to allow his chief telegrapher, Thomas Eckert, to accept Lincoln's invitation, even though the president had playfully requested his unusual strength - he could reportedly "break a fire poker on his arm" - and could act as a bodyguard. It was after 8 o'clock when the Lincolns entered their carriage and drove to the theater." I think it's time to go," Lincoln told Colfax, "although I'd rather stay." Although nothing provided a greater diversion than the theater during the miserable nights of his presidency, Lincoln did not need to escape on this happy evening. Nevertheless, he made a promise." The ad said we'd be there," he told his bodyguard William Crook, who was off that night, "and I can't let the people down." Clara Harris-the daughter of Mary's friend Senator Ira Harris-and her fiancé, Major Henry Rathbone, joined the Lincolns in their carriage. As the Lincolns rode to Ford's Theatre on Tenth Street, John Wilkes Booth and three conspirators were a block away at Herndon Court. That morning, he learned that Lincoln was planning to perform at the theater and decided that tonight would be the best opportunity for them. The stout Lewis Powell, accompanied by David Herold, was assigned to kill Seward at his home on Lafayette Square. Meanwhile, carriage maker George Atzerodt would shoot the vice president in his suite at the Kirkwood Hotel. Booth knew the stage crew well enough to guarantee his actions, and he would assassinate the president.Just as Brutus was honored for killing the tyrant Caesar, Booth believed he would be honored for killing an even "greater tyrant". Booth was familiar with the stage crew and could guarantee his actions, and he would assassinate the president. Just as Brutus was honored for killing the tyrant Caesar, Booth believed he would be honored for killing an even "greater tyrant". Assassinating Lincoln was not enough. Booth knew that, in the end, Brutus' plot had been foiled by Mark Antony, whose famous speech made the assassin a fugitive and Caesar a martyr. William Henry Seward, Lincoln's Mark Antony, must not live. Finally, in order to plunge the entire North into chaos, the vice president must also die. The three assassinations were scheduled for 10:15 p.m. Seward remained bedridden, having enjoyed the best day since the near-fatal carriage accident nine days earlier. His daughter, Fanny Seward, noted in her diary that he had slept well the night before and had "eaten solid food for the first time." In the afternoon, he "listened with pleasure to the account of the events of the Cabinet meeting" at which Fred Seward, as assistant secretary, attended in place of his father. Later in the afternoon, he listened to Fanny's reading of Enoch Arden, and said he enjoyed it very much. The three-story house was full of people. In addition to half a dozen house servants and the State Department messenger who lived on the third floor, Stanton assigned two soldiers to stay with Seward. In the late afternoon, Stanton stopped by to see his friends and colleagues. He stayed for a while, chatting with other visitors and reminding him that War Department employees planned to serenade him that evening at his home six blocks away. He stayed for a while, chatting with other visitors and reminding him that War Department employees planned to serenade him that evening at his home six blocks away. After all the guests left, the quiet arrangements for the evening began. To ensure that Seward was not left alone, family members took turns sitting at his bedside. That night, Fanny was scheduled to stay with him until 11 p.m., when her brother Gus would take over. George Robinson, one of Stanton's soldiers assigned to the family, was on standby. Shortly after 10 p.m., Fanny noticed that her father had fallen asleep. She closed the pages of "The Charlemagne Chronicles," turned off the gaslight and sat down on the other side of the bed."

 usa.01865414.d:0 "On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth had been pining for Lincoln for months before he decided to shoot him at close range in a darkened theater. When Abraham Lincoln was re-elected in November 1864, Booth began plotting against the president, disgusted by his anti-slavery stance and his waging of war against the South. At first, the famous actor hoped to kidnap Lincoln and take him to Richmond in exchange for Confederate prisoners of war. However, the fall of Richmond and the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee a few days later prompted him to consider more drastic action. On the evening of April 14, only two hours before entering Ford's Theatre, Booth met with three associates-Louis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerode-at a boarding house and unveiled His new plan; assassination. He promised to take care of Lincoln himself, allegedly handing Secretary of State William Seward to Powell and Vice President Andrew Johnson to Herold and Atzerodt. Booth may also have wanted to kill Ulysses S. Grant, whom Lincoln had invited to the theater that night, but the top Union general had left Washington earlier that day.Powell, 20, was a former Confederate soldier wounded at Gettysburg; Herold, 22, was a pharmacist's assistant; and Atzerod, 29, was a German-born coach painter, all of whom had knowledge of the kidnapping plot (along with a number of other Confederate agents and sympathizers). Now, despite some skepticism expressed by Atzerodt at the meeting, the prosecutor later asserted that the three men left Booth with every intention of committing murder."

Although already familiar with the layout of Ford's Theatre, Booth had attended a rehearsal the day before to better rehearse his plan to shoot Lincoln in the State Box and then escape to the alley next to the theatre. That morning, he came back to the theater to get his letters and spoke cordially with Harry Ford, the brother of the theater's owner, in the front lobby. By the time the Lincolns arrived, John Wilkes Booth was already seated in the theater, and the show had already begun when the president and his party entered the flag box in the dress area. The notes of "Hail to the Commander-in-Chief" brought the audience to its feet, where they applauded wildly and reached for the President. Lincoln "smiled and bowed," then took a seat in a comfortable armchair in the center of the box, with Mary by his side. Clara Harris sat at the other end of the box, while Henry Rathbone sat on a small sofa to her left. While observing the president and the first lady, one of theatergoers noticed that she "put her hand on his knee most of the time and often called his attention to some humorous situation on the stage." Mary herself later recalled that as she got closer to her husband, she once whispered, "What would Miss Harris think of me putting my arm around you like that?" Lincoln looked at her and smiled." She won't think anything of it." During the performance, the White House valet delivered a message to the president. about 12 minutes after 10:00, a well-dressed John Wilkes Booth showed his card to the footman and received permission to enter the box. Once inside the hallway, Booth used a stick between the door and the wall to block the door. From here, a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that earlier in the day, Booth drilled a peephole in this second door. Booth, who knew the play "Our American Cousin" like the back of his hand, waited for the shot to be fired at about 10:15 p.m. A hilarious line from actor Harry Hawk in the play elicited laughter: "Don't know the manners of good society, eh? Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal – you sockdologizing old man-trap!" Lincoln was laughing at this line when Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with a pistol."

 usa.01870.d:0 "As Lincoln leaned forward, Henry Rathbone tried to catch the intruder. Booth pulled out a knife, slashed Rathbone in the chest, and then managed to jump from the box to the stage 15 feet below." One witness recalled, "As he jumped up, a spur on his riding boot caught in the fold of the American flag draped in front of him, causing him to partially land on his hands and feet as he hit the stage. Another bystander noted that "he was in great pain," but "he struggled desperately to get up. He raised "his shining dagger into the air, which reflected like a diamond," and shouted the now-historic words of the Virginia motto - "Sic Semper Tyrannis" - and ran from the stage. Until the screams emanated from the president's box, many in the audience thought this dramatic moment was part of the play. Then they saw Mary Lincoln waving her hands frantically." They shot the president!" she shouted." They shot the president!" Charles Leale, a young doctor sitting near the president's box, was the first to react." He recalled, "When I went to the president, he was almost dead, his eyes were closed." Unable to find the wound at first, he stripped Lincoln's jacket and collar. Examining the base of the skull, he found "a perfectly smooth opening caused by a ball." Using his fingers "as probes" he removed "the clot firmly stuck to the hair," freeing up the flow of blood and relieving to some extent the pressure on Lincoln's brain. Another doctor, Charles Sabine Taft, soon arrived and decided to move the president from the crowded box to a room across the street at the Peterson Hotel. By this time, people were already gathering in the streets. Word began to spread that the assassins had attacked not only Lincoln, but Seward as well. Joseph Sterling, a young employee of the War Department, rushed to inform Stanton of the disaster. On the way, he met his roommate, J.G. Johnson, who joined him in this terrible task." When Johnson and I arrived at the Stanton residence," Sterling recalled, "I was out of breath," so when Stanton's son Edwin Jr. opened the door, Johnson was the one who spoke." We're here," Johnson said, "to tell your father that President Lincoln has been shot." Little Stanton hurried over to his father, who was already undressed and ready for bed. Sterling recalled that when the Secretary of War came to the door, "he called out to me in his heavy tones, 'Mr. Sterling, what news have you brought? Sterling told him that Lincoln and Seward had both been assassinated. Stanton desperately hoped that the news was only a rumor, but he remained calm and skeptical." Oh, it can't be so," he said, "it can't be so!" But when another clerk came to the door to describe the attack on Seward, Stanton immediately had his carriage brought over and, despite the appeals of his wife, who feared he might also be targeted, he headed for Seward's house in Lafayette Square. The news reached Gideon Welles almost simultaneously. He was already in bed when his wife reported that someone was at the door." The naval secretary recorded in his diary that "I got up at once," and opened the window, when James, my messenger, reported to me that Mr. President Lincoln had been shot, "and that Seward and his son had been assassinated. Wells found the story "very incoherent and improbable," but the messenger assured him that he had gone to Seward's house to verify its veracity before coming to see him. Wells, too, despite his wife's protests, got dressed and set out in the foggy night for Seward's house on the other side of the square.M Upon arriving at Seward's house, Wells and Stanton were shocked at what they found. There was blood everywhere - "the white woodwork in the entryway," on the stairs, on the women's clothes, on the bedroom floor. Seward's bed, Wells recalled, "was soaked with blood. The Secretary of State was lying on his back and the upper part of his head was covered by a piece of cloth which extended up to his eyes". Wells whispered questions to Dr. Verdi, but Stanton could not suppress his impassioned voice until the doctor asked for silence. After looking at Fred's unconscious form, the two men walked down the stairs together. In the lower lobby, they exchanged what information they had about the president. Wells thought they should go to the White House, but Stanton thought Lincoln was still at the theater. Army quartermaster Montgomery Meigs, who had just reached the door, pleaded with them not to go to Tenth Street, where thousands of people had gathered. At their insistence, he decided to join them."

 usa.28651.d:0 "Fred Seward later wrote that "nothing unusual seemed to happen when a tall, well-dressed, but unidentified man appeared at the door." Powell told the servant who answered the door that he had prepared some medicine for Mr. Seward and had been ordered by his physician to deliver it himself." I told him that he could not go up," the servant later testified, "and that if he would give me the medicine, I would show Mr. Seward how to take it. Powell was so insistent that the boy stepped aside. When he went down the hallway, Fred Seward stopped him." My father is asleep; give me the medicine and instructions; I will bring them to him." Powell argued that he had to deliver them himself, but Fred refused. At this point, Fred recalled, the intruder was "apparently standing still." He started to walk down the hall, then "suddenly turned around again, jerked up and forward, drew a Navy revolver, and he muttered and pointed it at my head and pulled the trigger." That was Fred's last memory of that night. The pistol missed, but Powell fired so savagely that Fred's skull was shattered in two places, exposing his brain and rendering him unconscious. Hearing the commotion, Private Robinson ran from Seward's bedside to the door. He slashed Robinson in the forehead with the knife, "partially knocking him out", and then headed for Seward. Fanny runs to Powell and begs him not to kill her father. Seward woke up when he heard the word "kill," giving him "a glimpse of the assassin's bent face" before the big Bowie knife plunged into his neck and face, cutting his cheek so badly that "the flap hung loosely from his neck." Strangely enough, he later recalled that his only impression was of what a beautiful man Powell was and "what a beautiful cloth that coat was made of".Fanny's screams brought her brother Gus into the room as Powell advanced again on Seward, who had been knocked to the ground by the force of the blow. Oddly enough, he later recalled that his only impression was of what a beautiful man Powell was and "what a beautiful cloth that coat was made of." Fanny's screams brought her brother Gus into the room as Powell again advanced on Seward, who had been knocked to the ground by the force of the blow. Gus and the wounded Robinson managed to pull Powell away, but not before he struck Robinson again and slashed Gus in the forehead and right hand. As Gus ran for his pistol, Powell rushed down the stairs and stabbed the young State Department courier, Emeric Hansel, in the back before he bolted out the door and fled through the city streets. The noise alerted the entire family. Anna sent servants to Dr. Tullio S. Verdi, while Pvt. Robinson, though bleeding from his head and shoulder, carried Seward to his bed and instructed Fanny to "stop the bleeding with clothes and water." Still concerned that another assassin might be hiding in the house, Frances and Anna checked the attic while Fanny searched the rooms on the living room floor. Dr. Verdi would never forget his first sight of Seward that night." He looked like a corpse that had lost a lot of blood. As I approached him, my feet were deep in a pool of blood. Blood was pouring from a large gash in his swollen cheek; the cheek was now open." The wound was so "terrible" and the "loss of blood so great" that Verdi thought the jugular vein must have been severed. Miraculously, it hadn't. Further examination revealed that the knife had been blocked by the metal device holding Seward's broken jaw in place. Strangely enough, the carriage accident saved his life. I could barely sponge the blood off his face and replace the stopper," Verdi recalled, "when Mrs. Seward called me to her side with a nervous look. Not understanding, he followed Frances to the next room, where he "found Frederick's head bleeding profusely." Fred's appearance was so "terrible" and his wounds so large that Verdi feared he would not survive, but through the use of "cold water plates" he was able to temporarily stop the bleeding.Once Fred's condition stabilized, Frances pulled Verdi to another room on the same floor." Fred's appearance was so "terrible" and his wounds so large that Verdi feared he would not survive, but through the use of a "cold water board" he was able to temporarily stop the bleeding. Once Fred's condition stabilized, Francis pulled Verdi into another room on the same floor." For God's sake, Mrs. Seward," asked the bewildered doctor, "what does all this mean?" The doctor found Gus lying in bed with stab wounds on his hands and forehead, but assured Frances that he would recover. Francis barely had time to absorb these words of comfort before he implored Dr. Verdi to see Private Robinson." I no longer doubted," Verdi recalled, "that my mind became as paralyzed; I followed her mechanically, and examined Mr. Robinson. He had four or five wounds on his shoulder." Are there any more?" Verdi asked, though not expecting the carnage to continue." Yes," Francis replied, "there is one more." She led him to Hansel, "moaning pitifully on the bed". Stripping the young man of his clothes, Verdi "found a deep wound above the small of the back, near the spine."" And all this," thought Verdi, "was done by one man-yes, all by one man!""

Earlier that afternoon, he had taken a carriage ride with his daughter Nettie, intending to stop at the White House to criticize Lincoln for his overly lenient approach to Reconstruction and for his failure to claim the popular vote. At the last minute, "unsure how [Lincoln] would take it," Chase decided to wait until the next day. He was sleeping soundly when a servant knocked on his bedroom door. The man shouting was a Treasury Department employee who had indeed witnessed the shooting, "a man jumped from the box onto the stage and fled from the back." Chase hoped that "he might be mistaken," but shortly thereafter, three more men arrived. Each "confirmed what I had been told, adding that Secretary Seward had also been assassinated, and that guards had been placed around the houses of all important officials, for fear of the extent of the conspiracy. My first impulse was to get up immediately and go to the President ...... But considering that I was unlikely to be able to offer any services, and that I might hinder those who could, I decided to wait for the morning and further information. After a while, the guards came - because it was thought that I was one of the doomed victims - and their heavy footsteps were heard under my window all night .... It was a horrible night."When Stanton and Wells arrived at the crowded room at the Peterson Hotel, they found Lincoln reclined on a bed to accommodate his tall stature. When Stanton and Wells arrived at the crowded room at the Peterson Hotel, they found Lincoln reclined on a bed to accommodate his tall stature. Wells noted that Lincoln had been stripped of his shirt and that "his large arms," "from his idle appearance, were of a size hardly to be imagined." His devastating wound, doctors reported with awe, "would have killed most men instantly, or within a few minutes. But Mr. Lincoln had such a strong life force" that he continued to fight the inevitable end. Mary spent much of the endless night crying in the living room next door as several female friends tried in vain to comfort her." She could only dully repeat the question, "Why didn't he shoot me? Why didn't he shoot me?" Although everyone in the room knew that the president was dying, Mary was not told because she feared she would break down. Taft recalled that whenever she walked into the room, "clean napkins were spread over the crimson stains on the pillows.

Pendle recalled that when Hay heard the news, "his face turned deathly pale and the color left his cheeks entirely." The two young men jumped into a wagon and picked up Senator Charles Sumner along the way. Mary agonized over whether to summon Ted, but was apparently persuaded that the emotional boy would be devastated if he saw what happened to his father. That night, Ted and his mentor went to see Aladdin at the Grover Theatre. The theater was decorated with patriotic signs, and a poem commemorating the recovery of Fort Sumter was read between performances. An eyewitness recalled that the audience was "enjoying the spectacle of Aladdin" when the theater manager approached, "pale as a ghost". A look of "mortal agony" crossed his face as he announced to the dumbfounded audience that the president had been shot at Ford's Theatre. In the ensuing chaos, Ted was seen "screaming like a fawn, in agony." Poor little Ted," recalled Pendle, as he cried his way back to the White House." Oh, Tom Penn! Tom Penn! Tom Penn!" Ted bawled." They killed Daddy. They've killed Daddy!" Pendle carried the little boy into Lincoln's bedroom. Turning down the bedspread, he helped Ted undress and finally laid him down."

I was walking through the narrow streets of the little town of Lugano, when my eyes were attracted by a well-known portrait suspended in front of a small book store. The portrait of Abraham Lincoln; and you will not wonder that the sight alone of the familiar features arrested one’s footsteps, as they hang there in that quaint, medieval, out-of-the-way place, looking around upon a scene so wholly foreign to that other world, of which the late President of the United States was so vividly the personification. I went up by an irresistible impulse of respect to look at it, and I was glad I did so, for I found beneath it in writing, and in Italian, an inscription which showed that the little portrait had in fact been attached to his house by the owner like a sacred image, at once a testimony of his own faith and feelings, and an appeal to those of his fellow-citizens. ‘This,’ said the inscription, ‘is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and so long as the sun shines on men, so long shall the name of him who redeemed four millions of slaves from captivity, of him who, clutching to his strong breast the faces of the American Union, fell a victim to horrible assassination – so long shall his name resound great, venerated, and blessed throughout the world.’”"

 usa.2866.d:0 "The dogs heard it first, rising from the southwest. Distant sounds, yet inaudible to human ears, of metal touching metal; of a hundred hoofs sending vibrations through the earth; of labored breathing from tired horses; of faint human voices. These early warning signs alerted the dogs sleeping under the Garretts’ front porch. At the farm, John Garrett, corn-house sentinel, was already awake and the first to hear their approach. William Garrett, lying on a blanket a few feet from his brother, heard them too.It was after midnight, and dark and still inside the farmhouse. Old Richard Garrett and the rest of his family had gone to bed hours ago.All was quiet, too, in the tobacco barn, where John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirator David Herold were sleeping. The barking dogs and the clanking, rumbling sound finally woke Booth. Recognizing the unique music of cavalry on the move, the assassin knew he had only a minute or two to react.Booth woke Herold. They snatched up their weapons and rushed to the front of the barn. “We went right up to the barn door and tried to get out,” Herold would recall, “but found it was locked.” The Garretts—suspecting the fugitives might steal horses—had imprisoned them! Booth wasted no time trying to pry the lock from its mountings. They had to flee the barn before Union troops surrounded it.Booth wheeled 180 degrees. “Come on!” he called to Herold and limped 50 feet to the back wall. “[W]e went directly to the back end of the barn, and we tried to kick a board off so we could crawl out,” Herold would say. Booth, who had fractured his left leg a couple of inches above the ankle when he jumped to the stage after shooting the president, could not leverage his full weight on his left foot to kick with the right. The board did not give. Herold fared no better.The Union column raced up the road and threw a cordon around the farmhouse. Lt. Edward Doherty of the 16th New York Cavalry and detectives Luther Baker and Everton Conger dropped from their saddles, leapt up the porch and pounded on the door. Richard Garrett walked downstairs in his nightclothes.David Herold panicked: “You had better give up,” he urged Booth. No, the actor declared, “I will suffer death first.”Doherty, Baker and Conger pounced as soon as old man Garrett opened the door. Conger barked first: “Where are the two men who stopped here at your house?”Startled, Richard Garrett replied: “They have gone.”“Gone where?,” Conger demanded.“Gone to the woods,” said Garrett.“What!” Baker interrupted. “A lame man gone into the woods?” Well, he had crutches, Garrett pointed out.“Will you show me where they are?” Baker continued.“I will,” Garrett promised, “but I will want my pants and boots.”Garrett’s interrogators refused to let him back into the house to dress, so his family passed his clothes to him through the door.Conger decided to play the old man’s game, at least momentarily: “Well, sir, whereabouts in the woods have they gone?”Garrett began a story of how the men came there without his consent, that he did not want them to stay, and that...Enough, Conger interrupted: “I do not want any long story out of you. I just want to know where these men have gone.”Richard Garrett was afraid, and he started his monologue all over again. Conger turned from the door and spoke gravely to one of his men: “Bring in a lariat rope here, and I will put that man up to the top of one of those locust trees.” Even under the threat of hanging, marveled Conger, Garrett “did not seem inclined to tell.” A soldier went to get the hemp persuader.John Garrett emerged from the corn house, walked up to the nearest cavalryman and asked whom they were pursuing. “That I cannot tell you,” the trooper answered, telling another soldier to take John to the house. When they got near the house, John saw Doherty, Conger and Baker on the front porch talking to his father. Spotting John Garrett, Conger bellowed to his soldier escort, “Where did you get this man from?” John Garrett came to the rescue of his tongue-tied father.“Don’t hurt the old man: He is scared. I will tell you where the men are you want to find,” he said.“That is what I want to know,” said an exasperated Conger. “Where are they?”Before John had time to answer, Doherty seized him by the collar, pushed him down the steps, put a revolver to his head and ordered him to tell him where the assassins were.“In the barn,” John Garrett cried out.Not good enough, warned Conger. Which of the three barns?In the tobacco barn, said Garrett."

 usa.28661.d:0 "Why would they hesitate? If the brave Confederates could charge Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg in December 1862 and suffer thousands of casualties, and if the gallant corps of the Army of Northern Virginia could make the disastrous, suicidal Pickett's Charge on the third day at Gettysburg, why couldn't 26 soldiers charge two civilians hiding in a barn under cover of darkness? Surely the honor of capturing Lincoln's assassin was worth the risk of some casualties. Even after John Garrett's failed mission, Dougherty, Conger, and Baker remained hesitant. These three men authorized Baker to act as their spokesman. He shouted an ultimatum to the occupiers." I want you to surrender. If you do not, I will burn this barn down in 15 minutes." It was Wednesday, April 26, 1865, at 2:30 a.m. From the time the 16th New York Regiment arrived at Garrett's farm to this moment, the fugitives had not said a word to their pursuers. Then a voice yelled out three questions from inside the barn." Who are you?" "What do you want?" "Who do you want?" It was Booth. The assassin walked up to the front of the smoke barn and looked through the gap between the two boards, mistaking the other man for an Army captain." We're looking for you," Baker replied, "and we know who you are. Hand over your weapon and come out!" Booth paused." Let's have a little time to think about it." Surprisingly, Baker agreed: "Very well." Ten or fifteen minutes passed. The hunters kept a keen vigil on all four walls of the barn to make sure their prey didn't slip out unnoticed. Herold naively believed that once he had explained his role, the soldiers would send him home. In his mind, he wasn't guilty of anything. John Wilkes Booth had killed Lincoln, and Lewis Powell had stabbed Secretary of State William Seward. Herold was just going along for the ride. Booth could have been roasted alive in a tobacco warehouse if he had wanted to, but Herold pleaded with Booth to release him. Some soldiers could hear his plea. Baker counted down with his pocket watch and shouted to Booth that he was running out of time. In five minutes, he would have burned the barn down. Booth agreed. There was no point in forcing Herold to die with him. The actor called out to Baker." Oh, Captain - here's a man who wants to surrender so badly." Too excited to remain silent, Dougherty exclaimed." Hand over your weapon." Yes, echoed Baker, "Make him surrender his weapon." Their demand confused Herold. Would they refuse him surrender unless he handed over Booth's guns? Herold knew that Booth would never surrender his guns." I don't have a gun," Herold pleaded. Dougherty didn't believe him." Hand over your weapon, and you can come out."" I don't have a weapon," Herold whimpered, "let me out." Baker scoffed, "We know exactly what you've got." The Garretts gave Baker and the other officers a complete list of the fugitives' weapons and equipment: two revolvers, a Spencer repeating carbine, a cutlass, a pistol belt, several blankets and the clothes on their backs." You're carrying a carbine," Baker insisted, "and you're going to have to turn it in." Booth spoke up to end the impasse: "The weapon is mine, and I've got it." Baker objected to the assassin." This man was carrying a carbine, and he had to hand it over." Booth retorted and reminded the bloviating officers, "Here's a man who wants to come out." Yes, Herold affirmed." Let me out, quick; I don't know anything about this man, he's a desperate character, and he's going to shoot me." Booth supported Herold's charade: "Let him out; the young man is innocent." Enough, Dougherty reasoned. If they could convince one of the fugitives to come out without a fight, why not forget the weapon, stop waiting, and take the man? The lieutenant turned to Baker." We'd better let him out."" No," retorted Baker, "wait until Mr. Conger gets here." Well, where is he? Dougherty asked. Out of sight, at the back of the barn, told to prepare to set fire." Open that door!" Dougherty ordered one of his troopers." I will take that man out myself." The lieutenant placed himself on the side of the door. If he wasn't in the line of fire, Booth couldn't see him or shoot him as he opened the door to let Herold out. Dougherty and Herold were inches apart, only the width of a barn wall, and they could hear each other's breathing. They caught a glimpse of each other through the gap between the boards."

 usa.28662.d:0 "Booth and Herold heard the soldiers rush and surround the barn. “Don’t make any noise,” Booth whispered. “Maybe they will go off thinking we are not here.” Conger heard someone moving around inside, rustling the hay. It was Herold, failing to heed Booth’s orders to take cover.Baker summoned John Garrett to his side and pointed to the tobacco house: “You must go in to the barn and get the arms from those men.” Garrett objected violently to the suicidal plan. Baker went on: “They know you, and you can go in.” Yes, Booth and Herold did know John Garrett—as the man who had ordered them out of his house, refused them the comfort of a bed and locked them in the barn.Baker explained that this mission was not optional: “Unless you do it, I will burn your property.” Baker didn’t mean just the tobacco barn.By now William Garrett had also emerged from the cover of the corn house and joined his brother near the tobacco barn. William pulled the key from his pocket and surrendered it to Baker.Baker stepped forward and shouted to Booth: “We are going to send this man, on whose premises you are, in to get your arms; and you must come out and deliver yourselves up.” Booth said nothing; it might be a trick. He readied himself for a dismounted charge by more than 20 cavalrymen the moment the door opened. Baker, key in hand, strode up to the barn door. He inserted the key, turned the lock and, slowly, opened the door. Booth remained invisible, hiding several yards away in the black inner recesses of the barn. He saw movement. He held his pistols tightly, thumbs ready to cock the hammers of the single-action Colts. But he held his fire. Baker seized John Garrett and half-guided, half-pushed him through the door and closed it behind him.John Garrett stood alone, in the dark, at the mercy of Lincoln’s killer. He spoke timidly, reporting that “the barn was surrounded, that resistance was useless, and that [you] had better come out and deliver [yourself] up.”A growling tenor voice, dripping with malice, replied from the darkness: “You have implicated me.”Garrett tried to reason with them: “Gentlemen, the cavalry are after you. You are the ones. You had better give yourselves up.”Like an apparition, Booth’s pale, haunting visage emerged from the void. Then he exploded: “Damn you! You have betrayed me! If you don’t get out of here I will shoot you! Get out of this barn at once!” Garrett, glimpsing Booth’s right hand in motion, turned and ran from the barn.Finally, at the climax of a 12-day manhunt that had gripped the nation, a heavily armed patrol of 16th New York Cavalry had cornered Lincoln’s assassin at the Garrett farm in Port Royal, Virginia. But at that critical moment, Conger and the others hesitated. Instead of ordering their men to rush the barn and take Booth, they had decided to talk him out, and then delegated a solitary, unarmed man, a civilian—and an ex-Rebel soldier, no less—to negotiate Booth’s surrender. It was a clear abdication of command responsibility. Twenty-six cavalrymen, each armed with a six-shot revolver, could pour a fusillade of 156 conical lead bullets into the barn before having to reload. Booth could fire 12 rounds from the revolvers and seven from his Spencer carbine. He wouldn’t have time to reload. Or the troops could, without warning, before they fired a shot, charge the barn and try to take Booth by surprise. In the dark, and in the few seconds before they seized him, Booth could not pick off more than a few of them. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton wanted Booth alive for questioning."

 usa.28663.d:0 "Then, in the last seconds before David Herold left the barn, Booth whispered the last words exchanged between them: “When you go out, don’t tell them the arms I have.”With that, Herold passed from fugitive to captive.Now Doherty, Baker and Conger faced a bigger problem. Booth remained in that barn, heavily armed and waiting for their next move. Yes, they possessed certain advantages. The assassin was surrounded and outnumbered 29 to one. Escape seemed impossible. But then, so had escape from an audience of more than a thousand people at Ford’s Theatre. Like a baited bear, Booth remained lethal.He wanted to go down fighting, not hanged like a petty thief. “I have too great a soul to die like a criminal,” he had written in his diary a few nights before. He had already perpetrated the most flamboyant public murder in American history. Tonight he would script his own end with a performance to equal his triumph at Ford’s.Booth enjoyed three tactical advantages: He occupied a fortified position, but his adversaries had to come in and get him; they were deployed in the open around the barn and could not see him, but he remained hidden and could see them; they wanted Booth alive and did not want to be killed by him, but he was ready to die, and to take some of them with him. Moreover, morning’s first light would illuminate the manhunters and render them perfect targets.Doherty wanted to wait until morning, but Baker and Conger argued against it. One of Doherty’s sergeants, Boston Corbett, volunteered for a suicide mission. He would slip into the barn alone and fight Booth man to man: “I offered to Mr. Conger, the detective officer, and to Lt. Doherty, separately, to go into the barn and take him or fight him—saying if he killed me his weapons would then be empty, and they could easily take him alive.” Three times Corbett volunteered, and each time Doherty vetoed him.Conger and Baker wanted to burn the barn. The flames and choking smoke would do the job for them, at no risk to the troops. Indeed, the only danger would be to those who had to lay kindling against the timbers. Booth might be able to shove his pistol into the four inches of space between the boards and shoot the men at point-blank range.Conger sent for the Garrett sons. He had one more job for them, he explained. They would lay the kindling. John Garrett gathered pine twigs and set them next to the barn. When he returned with a second armful and bent low to arrange the pile, the rustling alerted Booth.Garrett jumped when he heard that familiar, menacing voice address him from the other side, just a foot or two away， “Young man, I advise you for your own good not to come here again.” Garrett dropped the kindling and retreated.If they were gathering kindling, Booth realized, the manhunters did not plan on waiting until sunrise. Booth decided to retake the initiative. He challenged his pursuers to honorable combat on open ground.“Captain,” he called out to Baker, “I know you to be a brave man, and I believe you to be honorable. I am a cripple.” Booth’s tantalizing admission thrilled every man who heard it. The manhunters had suspected, but were not absolutely sure, that the man in the barn was John Wilkes Booth. They had gotten reports that Lincoln’s assassin was lame, and now the man in the barn confirmed it. “I have got but one leg,” Booth continued. “If you will withdraw your men in line 100 yards from the door, I will come out and fight you.”As a sign of good faith Booth revealed that he had chosen, at least up to now, to spare Baker’s life: “Captain, I have had half a dozen opportunities to shoot you, but I did not.”Baker’s eyes darted to the burning candle he held improvidently in his hand. Conger suggested that Baker relieve himself of the inviting target immediately.This was better than Shakespeare. Lincoln’s assassin had just challenged 29 men to a duel. Or was it, in Booth’s mind, a knightly trial by combat, with victory the reward to the just? Baker declined the glove: “We did not come here to fight you, we simply came to make you a prisoner.”The assassin repeated his challenge but reduced the distance to offer more generous odds to his opponents: “If you’ll take your men 50 yards from the door, I’ll come out and fight you. Give me a chance for my life.”\NAgain Baker declined."

 usa.28664.d:0 ""“Well, my brave boys, prepare a stretcher for me!” Booth jauntily replied.Conger turned to Baker: “We will fire the barn.”“Yes,” his fellow detective agreed, “the quicker the better.”Conger bent over and lit the kindling.Within minutes an entire corner of the barn was blazing brightly. The fire illuminated the yard with a yellow-orange glow that flickered eerily across the faces of the men of the 16th. Booth could see them clearly now but held his fire.As the fire gathered momentum, it also lit the inside of the barn so that now, for the first time, the soldiers could see their quarry in the gaps between the slats. Booth had three choices: stay in the barn and burn alive; raise a pistol barrel to his head and blow out his brains; or script his own blaze of glory by hobbling out the front door and doing battle with the manhunters. He would not stay in the barn. And suicide? Never.He moved to the center of the barn, swiveled his head in every direction, measuring how quickly the flames were engulfing him. He glanced toward the door and hopped forward, a crutch under his left arm and the carbine in his right, the butt plate against his hip. “One more stain on the old banner,” Booth cried out, conjuring up the Confederate battle flag.Sergeant Corbett watched Booth’s every move. Corbett had, by stealth, peeked between one of the gaps between the barn’s vertical boards. Booth “turn[ed] towards the fire, either to put the fire out, or else to shoot the one who started it, I do not know which; but he was then coming right towards me...a little to my right—a full breast view.” Now Booth was within easy range of Corbett’s pistol. But the sergeant held his fire: “I could have shot him...but as long as he was there, making no demonstration to hurt any one, I did not shoot.”Corbett poked the barrel of his revolver through the slit in the wall and aimed it. The sergeant described what happened next:“Finding the fire gaining upon him, [Booth] turned to the other side of the barn and got towards where the door was; and, as he got there, I saw him make a movement towards the floor. I supposed he was going to fight his way out. One of the men who was watching told me that [Booth] aimed his carbine at him. He was taking aim with the carbine, but at whom I could not say. My mind was upon him attentively to see that he did no harm; and, when I became impressed that it was time, I shot him.”Instantly Booth dropped the carbine and crumpled to his knees. He could not rise. He could not lift his arms. He could not move at all.Like sprinters cued by a starting gun, Baker rushed into the barn with Conger at his heels. Baker caught Booth before he toppled over and Conger seized the assassin’s pistol, having to pry it out of the actor’s grasp.“It is Booth, certainly,” Conger cried jubilantly.Baker glared disapprovingly: “What on earth did you shoot him for?”“I did not shoot him,” Conger protested. “He has shot himself!”Conger raised Booth up and asked, “Where is he shot?” Conger searched for the wound: “Whereabout is he shot—in the head or neck?” Conger examined Booth’s neck and found a hole where blood was running out. “Yes, sir,” Conger deduced. “He shot himself.”“No, he did not,” Baker said.There are better places to continue this debate, Conger suggested: “Let us carry him out of here: This place will soon be burning.” They carried Booth under the locust trees a few yards from the door and laid him on the grass.Conger looked back at the barn: “It was burning so fast; and there was no water, and nothing to help with.” He went back to the locust trees. Gazing down on Booth’s broken body, “I supposed him to be dead. He had all the appearance of a dead man.” Then Booth opened his eyes and moved his lips.Conger called for water, and a soldier offered his canteen. Baker produced a tin cup, and they splashed some of the water on Booth’s face and poured a little into his mouth. He spit it out. He could not swallow; he was almost completely paralyzed. He tried to speak.Conger and Baker bent down and put their ears close to Booth’s mouth. After several attempts, Lincoln’s assassin spoke: “Tell mother, I die for my country.” Conger wanted desperately to confirm the accuracy of what Booth had said. These might be the assassin’s historic last words, and they must be reported to the nation exactly as Booth said them.Enunciating each syllable slowly and clearly so that Booth could understand him, Conger repeated the phrase verbatim. “Is that what you say?” the detective asked.\N“Yes,” the assassin whispered."

 usa.28665.d:0 "The tobacco barn was now fully ablaze. The detectives shouted for everyone to retreat to the Garrett house. Several men seized Booth by the arms, shoulders and legs and marched quickstep to the farmhouse. They climbed up the stairs and laid Booth flat on the wood-planked piazza. Blood pooled under his head and stained the floorboards. The Garrett girls carried an old straw mattress from the house and laid it on the porch. Conger and the others folded it in half and laid Booth’s head and shoulders on it. Lucinda Holloway, a Garrett relative, carried out a pillow and gently placed it under his head.On the porch, Conger observed, Booth “revived considerably. He could then talk so as to be intelligibly understood, in a whisper.”Booth asked for water and Conger and Baker gave it to him. He asked them to roll him over and turn him facedown. Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth’s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: “He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, ‘Kill me.’”Booth wanted to cough. He asked Conger to put his hand upon his throat and press down. The detective complied, but nothing happened.“Harder,” Booth instructed Conger.“I pressed down as hard as I thought necessary, and he made very strong exertions to cough, but was unable to do so.”Conger, guessing that Booth feared that some asphyxiating obstruction was stuck in his throat, told Booth: “Open your mouth, and put out your tongue, and I will see if it bleeds.” Conger reassured Booth: “There is no blood in your throat; it has not gone through any part of it there.”“Kill me,” Booth again implored the soldiers. “Kill me, kill me!”“We don’t want to kill you,” Conger comforted him. “We want you to get well.”Conger wanted Booth alive so they could bring him back to Washington. But it was obvious that John Wilkes Booth was not going back alive. Who had fired that shot? Conger demanded to know. He walked away in search of the trigger-happy trooper.Presently, Boston Corbett came forward, snapped to attention, saluted Conger and proclaimed, “Colonel, Providence directed me.”Corbett made the same confession to his commanding officer, Doherty, claiming that he had shot Booth only because he believed the assassin was about to open fire on the soldiers. And, Corbett continued, he did not intend to kill Booth. He wanted only to inflict a disabling wound. Several soldiers compared the location of Booth’s wound with that of Lincoln’s. Perhaps, they marveled, God’s justice had directed Corbett’s bullet to the back of the assassin’s head. Corbett, too, wondered: “[W]hile Booth’s body lay before me, yet alive, but wounded, and when I saw that the bullet had struck him just back of the ear, about the same spot that his bullet hit Mr. Lincoln, I said within myself, ‘What a fearful God we serve.’”Kneeling at Booth’s side, Lucinda Holloway gazed upon his face—“luminous” is how she remembered it for the rest of her life. Booth stuck out his tongue. He was thirsty. “I took my hand kerchief and dipped it in water and moistened his lips,” she would recall. “I again moistened his lips and he repeated his message to his mother. Soon he gasped, and I again moistened his lips and tongue a third time.”Booth rallied and opened his eyes.“The damn rebel is still living!” a soldier exclaimed.“My hands,” Booth whispered. Baker raised them up for Booth to see. For the last time John Wilkes Booth beheld the hands, now helpless, that had slain a president. Tenderly, Holloway massaged his temples and forehead. Her fingertips felt the life draining out of him: “The pulsations in his temples grew weaker and weaker.”Mustering all his remaining strength, Booth looked at his hands and spoke again: “Useless, useless.”His breathing turned sporadic and labored, and he gasped for breath every few minutes. His lips turned purple and his throat swelled.The rising sun nudged above the horizon and colored the eastern sky. In Albany, New York, mourners who had waited in line all night filed past Abraham Lincoln’s remains, displayed in the state Capitol’s Assembly Chamber. That afternoon the funeral train would pull out of the station, heading west to the prairies. Lincoln would be home soon.Booth gasped again.The sun broke free from the horizon and flooded Garrett’s farm with light, which shone on Booth’s face. The soldiers tried to shield his eyes by draping clothes over the back of a chair that they set up on the porch between Booth and the sun.The stage grew dark. His body shuddered. Then John Wilkes Booth was dead. The chase for Abraham Lincoln’s assassin was over."

They climbed the steps of the wooden gallows, built overnight, past pre-digged graves and stacks of gun cases that served as coffins. On the crowded platform, they were hooded and bound with strips of white cloth. Ropes were placed over their heads. The three men and one woman were found guilty in the plot to assassinate "the late President Abraham Lincoln," as official documents say. Mary E. Surratt - the first woman to be executed by the federal government - Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt and David Herold were convicted by a military tribunal of conspiring with John Wilkes Booth to murder Lincoln. Booth was killed while trying to escape after shooting Lincoln at Ford's Theatre on April 14. All of those convicted were local Confederate sympathizers who were implicated in the plans of Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward to first try to kidnap Lincoln and later kill him. Seward survived a brutal knife attack by Powell the night Lincoln was shot. Johnson escaped harm when Atzerodt lost his nerve and failed to carry out his part of the operation. Herold had helped Booth escape, and was, as one expert put it, "the man who got away." By most accounts, Surratt knew of the plot and abetted the plotters from her boarding house on H Street NW. The four men lined up - their arms handcuffed and their feet shackled - as a police officer read the execution order, and photographer Alexander Gardner pointed two cameras at the gallows from about 100 feet away. He captured the scene."

 usa.2000.d:0 "The Last letter from Major Sullivan Ballou, written to his wife leading up to the battle at First Bull Run. \NHeadquarters, Camp Clark Washington, D.C., July 14, 1861\NMy Very Dear Wife:\NIndications are very strong that we shall move in a few days, perhaps to-morrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write a few lines, that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine, O God be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battle-field for any country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American civilization now leans upon the triumph of government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution, and I am willing, perfectly willing to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government, and to pay that debt.\NBut, my dear wife, when I know, that with my own joys, I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with care and sorrows, when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it, as their only sustenance, to my dear little children, is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.\NI cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night, when two thousand men are sleeping around me, many of them enjoying the last, perhaps, before that of death, and I, suspicious that Death is creeping behind me with his fatal dart, am communing with God, my country and thee.I have sought most closely and diligently, and often in my breast, for a wrong motive in this hazarding the happiness of those I loved, and I could not find one. A pure love of my country, and of the principles I have often advocated before the people, and "the name of honor, that I love more than I fear death," have called upon me, and I have obeyed.Sarah, my love for you is deathless. It seems to bind me with mighty cables, that nothing but Omnipotence can break; and yet, my love of country comes over me like a strong wind, and bears me irresistibly on with all those chains, to the battlefield. The memories of all the blissful moments I have spent with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply grateful to God and you, that I have enjoyed them so long. And how hard it is for me to give them up, and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our boys grow up to honorable manhood around us.\NI know I have but few claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me, perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar, that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, nor that, when my last breath escapes me on the battle-field, it will whisper your name.Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless, how foolish I have oftentimes been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears, every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot, I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.But, O Sarah, if the dead can come back to this earth, and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you in the garish day, and the darkest night amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours always, always, and, if the soft breeze fans your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air cools your throbbing temples, it shall be my spirit passing by.Sarah, do not mourn me dear; think I am gone, and wait for me, for we shall meet again.\NAs for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care, and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers, I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.\N- Sullivan"

 usa.2001.d:0 "47 years prior, Francis Scott Key penned “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a poem, which later, when adapted to music, would be come the United States of America’s national anthem.The action that Key witnessed was the British bombardment of Fort McHenry, a star-shaped fort that guarded the water approaches to Baltimore, Maryland, named after a Maryland signer of the Constitution and the third Secretary of War, James McHenry.Throughout the night of September 13, 1814, the fort and its defenders withstood constant shelling from the British fleet, and when dawn broke on September 14th, the flag still fluttered above the ramparts. Coupled with a setback at the battle of North Point in which British General Robert Ross was killed, the Americans, aided by Maryland militia, safely defended the city and harbor.\NForty-seven years after Key penned his poem aboard a ship where he had been confined pending the British assault on Fort McHenry, his grandson would also find himself in a similar predicament.Frank (also commonly referred to as Francis) Key Howard was arrested on September 13, 1861 for his pro-Southern viewpoints as editor of the Baltimore Exchange. His paper had been critical of President Abraham Lincoln’s policies, namely the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and the declaration of martial law.Howard would be confined inside Fort McHenry, which would be used primarily as a military prison as the war progressed. Initially, though, it housed arrested pro-Southern (or suspected Confederate sympathizers) from the surrounding area.With his cell in the second story of the fort, which gained the nortorious nickname as “An American Bastille,” Howard would pen a very eloquent and ironic reflection of his current predicament:\nWhen I looked out in the morning, I could not help being struck by the odd, and not so pleasant a coincidence. On that day, forty-seven years before . . . my grandfather had witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry. . . . As I stood upon the very scene of that conflict, could not but contrast my position with his . . . . The flag which he so proudly hailed, I saw waving, at the same place, over the victims of as vulgar and brutal a despotism as modern times have witnessed.\nHoward would eventually pen a book about his time as a political prisoner inside Fort McHenry, titled “Fourteen Months in the American Bastilles,” completed by December 1862. When it was published by Baltimore publishers in October 1863, the two responsible editors were both arrested for selling the work.History can be interesting like that: thrusting two Keys (or a Key and Howard, to be more accurate) at one location that underscored the forty-seven years of change between wars.As the different anniversaries of the War of 1812 and American Civil War coincide, we are afforded an opportunity to look at the similarities and lasting legacies of both conflicts.The War of 1812 cemented the United States as a sovereign nation and tied up loose ends from the American Revolution. The war provided a measuring stick in which, a short few years later, President James Monroe (who was both Secretary of State and War during the War of 1812) would issue the Monroe Doctrine, establishing American hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. In a twist, the British provided nominal support for this declaration.With the war’s successful conclusion, people flooded westward, heroes rose to prominence, i.e. Andrew Jackson, and the country and Americans saw the war as a victory for American democracy. On the heels of the war came a period of time classified as the “Era of Good Feelings.”\NYet, in that “Era of Good Feelings” were sown the seeds of discontent. Within a few short years, the country would face a crisis in Missouri that would be averted with the aptly named “Missouri Compromise.” Eventually, compromises would run out and sectional differences would tear the country apart.\NDuring the American Civil War, Fort McHenry went from a beacon of American freedom to a pen holding dissidents against the same flag that Key so fervently hoped would still be waving when dawn broke on September 14, 1814. With the policies of Lincoln—a product of the frontier himself—the United States emerged from “a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.” By tactics that bent and sometimes temporarily broke his Constitutionally sanctioned powers, Lincoln saved Maryland and, with it, the United States—much like the defenders of Fort McHenry did forty-seven years before."

 #Dakota war
 dakota.1.t:0 "1862 Dakota War"
 dakota.1.d:0 "In 1862, Minnesota was still a young state, part of a frontier inhabited by more than one million Indians. Times were hard and Indian families hungry. When the U.S. government broke its promises, some of the Dakota Indians went to war against the white settlers. Many Dakota did not join in, choosing to aid and protect settlers instead. The fighting lasted six weeks and many people on both sides were killed or fled Minnesota. Former Minnesota governor Henry Sibley led an expedition of soldiers and Dakota scouts against the Dakota warriors. The war ended on December 26, 1862, when thirty-eight Dakota Indians were hanged in Mankato in the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Afterward, the government forced most of the remaining Dakota to leave Minnesota. For white Minnesotans, their experience of blood and terror negated all promises they had made to the Dakota. Stories and history books told about the great "Minnesota Massacre," but for many years the Indian side of the story was ignored.The Minnesota River begins its journey to the Mississippi in west-central Minnesota.  It flows south and west then turns sharply north and east toward St. Paul.  At the sharp bend in the river is a natural crossing that the Sioux Indians (Dakota) called Oiyuwege, meaning “the place of the crossing”.  French explorers called it Traverse des Sioux, or “crossing place of the Sioux”.  For centuries the great buffalo herds migrated across the plains of present day Minnesota and crossed the Minnesota River at Traverse des Sioux.  This spot became a crossroads and meeting place for people of many cultures.  A town named St. Peter grew near this historical crossroads.  To the west, the Great Plains was the home of the Sioux Indians and for centuries they lived in harmony with the buffalo and other wildlife.  However, to the east were the pioneers from Scandinavia and Germany and they were pressing ever westward onto the plains.  The two cultures clashed in southern Minnesota Territory and violence flared up in 1862 resulting in the loss of life of nearly 1,000 settlers and Indians.  In twenty Minnesota counties, bands of Sioux warriors swept down on isolated farms and settlements, killing the men, capturing women and children, and burning or plundering property. About thirty persons were killed in Nicollet County. This is the story of Norwegian territorial pioneers in one county (Nicollet) and one township (New Sweden) that got caught up in the war.  The letters written to Norway from Nicollet County, and translated for this article, describe the terror that filled the Minnesota River Valley.\NThe Treaty of Traverse des Sioux\NIn 1851, at Traverse des Sioux, the Sioux Indians ceded 24 million acres of tribal land to the U.S. Government.  This land was opened to settlement in 1853, leaving 7,000 Sioux living on a narrow reservation of two million acres along the Minnesota River.  In 1858, the Sioux ceded an additional one million acres of land.  At the same time the government tried to turn the nomadic Sioux into farmers. This divided the Sioux into two groups, those that took on the ways of the whites, and those that remained faithful to traditional tribal ways.  This division would impact life in Minnesota Territory and the outcome of the Sioux Uprising."

 dakota.2.d:0 ""I surrendered at Camp Release and gave my gun to Samuel J. Brown. He put me under guard, but said I would not be a prisoner very long. I was a prisoner for four years, being sent to Rock Island. Nothing was proved against me except that I was in some of the battles against the whites. I took no part in killing the settlers and was opposed to such work."\NWakandayamani (George Quinn), 1898 \nOn September 23, Henry Sibley defeated a Dakota force led by Little Crow at Wood Lake. Three days later, the Dakota Peace Party turned over hostages at a spot that became known as Camp Release. The Dakota delivered more than 269 captives immediately; within a few days, a total of about 285 captives were handed over. Sibley later wrote,\N"The Indians and half-breeds assembled . . . in considerable numbers, and I proceeded to give them very briefly my views of the late proceedings; my determination that the guilty parties should be pursued and overtaken, if possible, and I made a demand that all the captives should be delivered to me instantly, that I might take them to camp."\NOn September 28, 1862, two days after the surrender at Camp Release, a commission of military officers established by Henry Sibley began trying Dakota men accused of participating in the war. Several weeks later the trials were moved to the Lower Agency, where they were held in one of the only buildings left standing, trader François LaBathe’s summer kitchen."

 dakota.3.d:0 "On September 28, 1862, two days after the surrender at Camp Release, a commission of military officers established by Henry Sibley began trying Dakota men accused of participating in the war. Several weeks later the trials were moved to the Lower Agency, where they were held in one of the only buildings left standing, trader François LaBathe’s summer kitchen. As weeks passed, cases were handled with increasing speed. On November 5, the commission completed its work. 392 prisoners were tried, 303 were sentenced to death, and 16 were given prison terms.President Lincoln and government lawyers then reviewed the trial transcripts of all 303 men. As Lincoln would later explain to the U.S. Senate:  \N"Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I ordered a careful examination of the records of the trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females."When only two men were found guilty of rape, Lincoln expanded the criteria to include those who had participated in “massacres” of civilians rather than just “battles.” He then made his final decision, and forwarded a list of 39 names to Sibley.On December 26, 1862, 38 Dakota men were hanged at Mankato.\NAt 10:00 am on December 26, 38 Dakota prisoners were led to a scaffold specially constructed for their execution. One had been given a reprieve at the last minute. An estimated 4,000 spectators crammed the streets of Mankato and surrounding land. Col. Stephen Miller, charged with keeping the peace in the days leading up to the hangings, had declared martial law and had banned the sale and consumption of alcohol within a ten-mile radius of the town.As the men took their assigned places on the scaffold, they sang a Dakota song as white muslin coverings were pulled over their faces. Drumbeats signalled the start of the execution. The men grasped each others’ hands. With a single blow from an ax, the rope that held the platform was cut. Capt. William Duley, who had lost several members of his family in the attack on the Lake Shetek settlement, cut the rope. After dangling from the scaffold for a half hour, the men’s bodies were cut down and hauled to a shallow mass grave on a sandbar between Mankato’s main street and the Minnesota River. Before morning, most of the bodies had been dug up and taken by physicians for use as medical cadavers.Following the mass execution on December 26, it was discovered that two men had been mistakenly hanged. Wicaƞḣpi Wastedaƞpi (We-chank-wash-ta-don-pee), who went by the common name of Caske (meaning first-born son), reportedly stepped forward when the name “Caske” was called, and was then separated for execution from the other prisoners. The other, Wasicuƞ, was a young white man who had been adopted by the Dakota at an early age. Wasicuƞ had been acquitted.\NLetter from Hdainyanka to Chief Wabasha written shortly before his execution:\N"You have deceived me.  You told me that if we followed the advice of General Sibley, and gave ourselves up to the whites, all would be well; no innocent man would be injured.  I have not killed, wounded or injured a white man, or any white persons.  I have not participated in the plunder of their property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution, and must die in a few days, while men who are guilty will remain in prison.  My wife is your daughter, my children are your grandchildren.  I leave them all in your care and under your protection.  Do not let them suffer; and when my children are grown up, let them know that their father died because he followed the advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man to answer for to the Great Spirit."

 dakota.7.d:0 ""He came here the other day and talked with me about the rascality of this Indian business until I felt it down to my boots."Abraham Lincoln on Henry Whipple's report during his visit to the President in the fall of 1862. \NHenry B. Whipple was born February 15, 1822, in Adams, New York, the son of John Hall and Elizabeth Wager Whipple. On June 30, 1859, Whipple was elected the first Protestant Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, an office he held until his death more than forty years later. He made regular missionary sojourns by wagon or coach through the rural areas of the state, often in mid-winter, preaching in cabins, school houses, stores, saloons, and Indian villages.Whipple was best known outside of Minnesota for his dedication to the welfare of Indian people and for his missionary work among the Dakota and Ojibwe. He returned from his first visitation of his diocese with a firm commitment to the establishment of Indian missions and the reform of the U.S. Indian system. He regularly included Indian villages on his visitations, built up the Episcopal mission to the Ojibwe based at White Earth Reservation, and appealed for support of Indian missions by addresses throughout the United States and Europe.\NAs an outspoken and prestigious advocate of Indian administration reform, Whipple was looked to as a leader by individuals and organizations concerned with the Indians’ welfare. He corresponded with congressmen, army officers, officials of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and presidents of the United States, urging that the Indians be dealt with honestly, justly and humanely, and that the existing system of Indian administration be thoroughly revised to permit the Indian to live in dignity and decency. He made numerous trips to Washington, D.C., especially during the 1860s, to plead in person for Indian reform and to expose abuses in the Indian service, appealed for support through newspapers and church publications, and lectured on Indian affairs.\NWhipple’s suggestions for reform of the Indian system included treating tribes as wards of the government instead of as independent nations; paying annuities in kind rather than in cash; providing practical industrial education for Indians and separate homesteads for those who wanted them; appointing honest Indian agents; dealing with Indians as individuals rather than as tribes; enforcing laws through the use of Native police and through trial, by a U. S. Indian commissioner, of any white men who violated Indian laws; concentrating different bands of a tribe onto a single reservation; and refusing to permit liquor to be sold to Indians.In addition to being consulted on Indian affairs by government officials, Whipple served on several commissions authorized to negotiate treaties or to oversee the Indian’s welfare, including the Sioux Commission (1876), the Northwest Indian Commission (1887), several commissions appointed to oversee annuity payments to the Chippewa of Minnesota (1860s), and the U.S. Board of Indian Commissioners (1895-1901). He also attended several Lake Mohonk Conferences of Friends of the Indian and served on the Episcopal Church’s Joint Committee to Secure Protection of the Civil Law for the Indians (1878-1883).\NIn the early years of his episcopate, Whipple’s espousal of Indian reform and commitment to Indian missions earned him the enmity of many whites who hated Indians, and led some of his fellow bishops to look upon him as a fanatic. His attitude was denounced most bitterly after the U.S.-Dakota War 1862, when, in appeals to the President and in the public press, he opposed wholesale executions and extermination or deportation of the Dakota."

 news.1.d:0 "In [GetDateText] Fort Sumter at Charleston Bay, South Carolina had been taken over by South Carolina and Confederate forces, and Confederate forces fired into the harbor for one day without interruption, causing the fort to surrender the day after the firing, but without any casualties. Robert Anderson's troops paraded out of Charleston Harbor and were allowed to keep the American flag on the harbor as a memento. Upon their return to New York, Robert Anderson and his flag became a symbol of American patriotism. Until that time, the flag was primarily used as a military flag or a convenient symbol of U.S. territory ..... and displayed on special occasions such as Independence Day. But in the weeks following Major Anderson's surprising move, it became something different. Suddenly, the Stars and Stripes flew from houses, storefronts, churches, over village greens and college campuses. This old flag meant something new. The abstract concept of the federal cause was transformed into something physical: a rag for which millions would fight, for which thousands would die."

 news.1861.d:0 "President Abraham Lincoln delivered his first inaugural address in Washington, D.C., today, in which he expressed no intention of interfering with the rights of the states, but rejected the legality of unilateral secession: "I believe in the eternal existence of a common law and constitutional union of the states. This permanence is implicit in the fundamental law of all governments, if not explicitly stated. It can be concluded that no legitimate government has set an end date for its fundamental law. It is not possible to end the Union, which will endure forever, by continually enforcing the provisions expressly set forth in our national Constitution, except by some act beyond the Constitution itself. It is in your hands, my fellow citizens, not in mine, to make the choice of civil war. The government will not attack you. You will not be attacked unless you provoke yourselves. You have not sworn to heaven to destroy the government, but I will make a most solemn promise to "maintain, defend and sustain it.""
