 CSA_congress_desc:0 "The Confederate Congress was both a temporary legislative convention of the Confederate States of America and a permanent legislative convention from 1861 to 1865. Its actions were primarily concerned with measures to establish a new national government for the Southern "Revolution" and to conduct a war that had to last as long as the Confederacy existed. Initially, it held temporary Congresses in Montgomery, Alabama, and Richmond, Virginia. The predecessor to the permanent legislature was the Provisional Congress of the Confederacy, which would help the Confederacy create a nation."
