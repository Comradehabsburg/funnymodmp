This will give us solid control over the Mississippi, which is the backbone of the Confederacy and will be a sufficient victory to convince our people of a swift end to this war.§ §7 The last plan is to strike deep into the Confederacy, taking Tennessee and Arkansas, as well as establishing a victory on the El Paso front. These minor victories together will ensure our people we have a descisive upper hand and give us a victory in the presidential election.§"
 USA_McClellan2:0 "§RWe have failed to accomplish the plan laid out by our campaign, and McClellan has managed to gain the upper hand in this election.§ §CWe do still have many months until the election concludes, and we cannot lose hope until the last moment, for these may be the last days of the Union.§ §8 To Win the election now, we must win a devistating victory against the Confederacy before the election begins. At least 2 of the previous plans must be simulataniously completed before the election concludes.§ §W This may seem impossible, but with the superiority of our will we may yet save the Union."
