 USA_ACW_1861_DESC:0 "The debate and compromise over slavery and "Manifest Destiny" has continued to shape the course of American history since the Declaration of Independence was issued in 1776, and now, with the Mexican War over, the Pig War failing to break out, and the election of 1860 slowly approaching Americans, the Republican Party is a major player. The Republican Party had great influence in the northern states and was likely to put Abraham Lincoln on the throne as the first Republican president, the split between the Southern and Northern Democrats, and the formation of the Constitutional Union Party would make the 1860 election a unique and most important election in American history. \N It will be a challenge for all Americans, the precarious United States of America, which is in danger of falling apart."
