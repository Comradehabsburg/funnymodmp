 LOADING_TIP_0:0"The fight must go on. The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one, or even one hundred defeats. -Abraham Lincoln"
 LOADING_TIP_1:0"In this great struggle, this form of government and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies succeed. There is more involved in this contest than is realized by everyone. ~ Abraham Lincoln"
 LOADING_TIP_2:0"The triumph of the Union is dispensable not only to the existence of our country to the well being of mankind. ~ Horace Greeley"
 LOADING_TIP_3:0"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.-Abraham Lincoln"
 LOADING_TIP_4:0"I wish it might be more generally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in. We have, as all will agree, a free government, where every man has a right to be equal with every other man. ~ Abraham Lincoln"
 LOADING_TIP_5:0"That from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion... We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.-Abraham Lincoln"
 LOADING_TIP_6:0"There had to be an end of slavery. Then we were fighting an enemy with whom we could not make a peace. We had to destroy him. No convention, no treaty was possible – only destruction. -Ulysses S. Grant"
 LOADING_TIP_7:0"You think slavery is right and should be extended; while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted. That I suppose is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference between us.-Abraham Lincoln, as quoted in letter to Alexander H. Stephens"
 LOADING_TIP_8:0"Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters 'U.S.'; let him get an edge on his button, and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, and there is no power on earth which can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship. ~ Frederick Douglass"
 LOADING_TIP_9:0"We have more men and more resources than these traitors and five times as much money. We must beat them in the end, but we must do it by poking them, butting them whenever we see them. By God, shall a United States ship of war hesitate to go in and destroy a dozen of these wretched Mississippi steamers? I am sick of hearing my officers talk of cotton-clad boats and impregnable rams. They should pitch in and destroy them. What matters it, general, whether you and I are killed or not. We came here to die. It is our business and must happen sooner or later. We must fight this thing out until there is no more than one man left and that man must be a Union man. Here's to his health.-David G. Farragut"
 LOADING_TIP_10:0"There are few things wholly evil or wholly good. Almost everything, especially of government policy, is an inseparable compound of the two, so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded.- Abraham Lincoln"
 LOADING_TIP_11:0"Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God, cannot long retain it。-Abraham Lincoln"

This is the kind of liberty–the liberty to do wrong–which Satan, Chief of the fallen Angels, was contending for when he was cast into Hell.-David Hunter, letter to Jefferson Davis"
 LOADING_TIP_13:0"The south went to war on account of slavery. South Carolina went to war, as she said in her Secession proclamation, because slavery would not be secure under Lincoln.John S. Mosby"
 LOADING_TIP_14:0"If slaves make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong. But they won't make soldiers. As a class they are wanting in every qualification of a soldier.

 LOADING_TIP_18:0"Confederate victory would destroy the United States.-James M. McPherson"
 LOADING_TIP_19:0"To the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.-William Davis"
 LOADING_TIP_20:0"The country and the army are mainly dependent upon slave labor for support.-Joseph E. Brown"
 LOADING_TIP_21:0"We have reproached the South for arbitrary conduct in coercing their people; at last we find we must imitate their example. We have denounced their tyranny for filling their armies with conscripts, and now we must follow their example. We have denounced their tyranny in suppressing freedom of speech and the press, and here, too, in time, we must follow their example. The longer it is deferred the worse it becomes.I say with the press unfettered as now we are defeated to the end of time. 'Tis folly to say the people must have news.-Letter from Union Gen. William T. Sherman to his brother John Sherman (1863)"
 LOADING_TIP_22:0"Will you suffer your soldier, captured in fighting your battles, to be in confinement for months rather than release him by giving for him that which you call a piece of property, and which we are willing to accept as a man? You certainly appear to place less value upon your soldier than you do upon your negro. I assure you, much as we of the North are accused of loving property, our citizens would have no difficulty in yielding up any piece of property they have in exchange for one of their brothers or sons languishing in your prisons.-Benjamin F. Butler"
